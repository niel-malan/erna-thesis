Hello Niel,

I hope you have recovered somewhat from the writing of Chapter 6?  And 
CONGRATULATIONS on the paper - that is excellent news.

Below are comments on Ch. 4.  All good, in the main.  I think you are 
making excellent progress, and I'm enjoying learning my way through your 
work!

===================

Overall.  Too many paragraphs for me!  It jars to have a new paragraph 
when the discussion centres around the same topic and follows on from 
the previous sentence.  e.g. lines 2365-2370.  New paragraph begins with 
"However..." that follows on the from the previous two-sentence 
paragraph.  In my opinion your descriptions of instrumentation would be 
improved and easier to read if you condensed into longer paragraphs.  To 
be fair this seems to be much more of an issue when you are discussing 
instrumentation, rather than other topics.  Section 4.3.2 is a fine 
example of this.

1st Paragraph: A language niggle of mine is wording such as "This 
thesis/chapter/book discusses... or This figure shows...".  Inanimate 
objects don't discuss.  Figures don't show.

I prefer wording such as "This thesis contains a discussion of..." or 
"This figure contains plots of...".   Totally up to you of course.  The 
literature is full of such constructions so who am I to argue.

Line 2131:  Missing full stop.

Section 4.3.  I really enjoyed this section and your discription of how 
to fill a reservoir without an air gap at the top full of vapour.  What 
a nice solution!!

Figure 4.1: Caption.  Maybe reword to "A schematic diagram of the...". 
Arrowed text showing "Pump" and "Valve" might help to quickly orient the 
reader, but in reality it is pretty obvious.
Line 2205: "...with a sapphire..."  Remove "a".
Line 2217: Sing/plural.  Times.  "...they can easily be measured..."
Line 2224: Sing/plural.  Systems.  "...they are..."
Line 2244: Hertz or hertz???
Line 2256: "...tend to be a expensive..."  Remove "a".
Figure 4.7.  A circle on Fig 4.7, similar to Fig 4.8 would be nice. 
Also, in the caption for both figures, an electron microscope 
"photograph" or "image"?
Figures overall.  In general, I found all your schematic figures very 
clear and easy to understand.  Very helpful to the novice!!!

Keep working mate, you hopefully can see the light at the end of the 
tunnel now?

Mick
