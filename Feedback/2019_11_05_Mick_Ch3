Hi Niel,

OK, chapter 3 reading has just concluded.  Your writing really is a 
pleasure to read, even when the topic is outside my own scientific 
comfort area.

Very nice.  I found fewer typos/grammar corrections.  Also I learned 
some things - chemistry is everywhere eh?

Line 1028: singular/plural.  "*IS* their reliability"
Line 1050: sentence truncated???
Line 1066: delete " a "
P39/P40: Do you *really* need to list all these 16 points summarising 
the pages??  Just reference the document as an alternative?  I didn't 
learn anything, and if I had to look them up, I'd likely go straight to 
the actual source material.
Line 1740: Replace "measures" with "measured"
Line 1765: singluar/plural.  "*HAS* the right"
Section 3.5.2.  I have first hand experience of the flash point of 
cooking oil/lard.
Line 2019: "of" not "fo"
Section 3.9.3: At my last medical, and a few years ago, I was warned for 
too high a blood triglyceride content...
Line 2079: "...chromatogram is very simple...".  I found the wording 
here to be a bit jarring - reword?
Line 2085: singular/plural.  "*are* the main"
Line 2093: sentence truncated???
Line 2098: missing space after "fuel"
Line 2098: Replace "These compounds are..." with "PUFA compounds are..." ???
Line 2116: singular/plural. "*they are* mearly"

Having line numbers in the .pdf is VERY helpful - it should be compulsory!!!

Summary of this chapter is that I learnt that chemistry, and 
particularly chemical testing/standards are entirely pervasive of all 
technological systems.  Of course, somehow being aware that dirty fuel 
will clog injectors and filters is a bit different from realising and 
appreciating all the tests and *science* involved in mitigating such 
potential problems.

I'm glad the medication is helping - you seem well on track.  Keep 
working hard - you're getting there!  More comments will follow as time 
allows.

Mick

PS I've just booked flights for a combined trip to 
Arecibo/UK/Switzerland in Jan and Feb next year.  Work/Personal/Work but 
it should be a fun trip, and involves the ionospheric work with SUPIM, 
plus some of the new work I've been doing on stratospheric ozone.

PPS Work on the house progresses slowly.  We have a (partial) kitchen 
once more, as well as a leaking sink.  I think it is a good omen to have 
build a leaking vessel, before we hopefully build a water-tight one!!!
