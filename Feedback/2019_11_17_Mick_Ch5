OK, comments on Ch.5.  I'm waiting for some analysis to run that takes a 
few hours each time - my laptop is hot enough to fry eggs on, so reading 
your thesis is a good alternative to any more work.

I had a paper published yesterday - a good start to the week :-)

==============================
Line 2425: "This thesis discusses...."  As before.
Throughout: GCxGC, LCxGC, SFCxGC.  Acronyms are defined in this chapter 
- up to you where you put the definitions.
Line 2451: "...instrumentation THAT can..."
Line 2476: "...decisions OF speed..." ???
Line 2488: "...on A given..."
Section 5.2: It would be nice to have Figure 5.1 at the start of this 
section on p66.  Simple figure, so you could easily shrink it to fit?
Line 2521: "...needs only TO resolve..."
Line 2526: Typo - "...shown showed..."
Line 2545: "...one set OF acceptable..."
Section 5.4: Surely it is possible to make an oil bath that doesn't 
contaminate the column???  Also, if oil can contaminate the column, why 
can't air???
Line 2617: "...304 GRADE stainless steel..." ???  Also, delete "d" from 
this line?
Line 2640: LaTeX issue on fraction.  I briefly checked the algebra in 
this section - looks fine to me!
Section 5.5.1:  My intuition on this was that the thermal conductivity 
of metals must intuitively be so high as to overcome competing effect 
that would cause hot-spots.  I'm amazed the difference was as much as 
17.5C!  One other thing here that I didn't find are what are the 
measurement errors on the thermal imagining???  You go to the trouble of 
doing the test, but don't provide accuracy or +- values on the thermal 
camera observations!!!   Based on the thermograph, I'd be surprised if 
you could accurately detect temperature differences of a few degrees.
Line 2845: sing/pl.  Values.  "...calibration WERE the..."
Section 5.5.6.  You've build your own thermocouple (!!!).  I imagine you 
were happy to have achieved this and solved your measurement problem? 
At least emphasise and get excited about how excellent the calibration 
is.    A final sentence at the end of this section could point this out 
- we had a problem, we fixed it, tick :-)  Or does that come in a future 
chapter?
Line 2991: "...mounted in A blind hole..."
Figures:  I'm assuming you still have to add Figures D.1, D.2, etc.?
Line 2983: "...electrical CONNECTIONS for..."
Line 2995: "...yet WERE stiff..."
Figure 5.13 Caption: Says "350C" but looks to be almost 400C?
Section 5.9.  Do you really need this section??  Result figures are 
coming in future chapters I'm sure.  At that point could you simply 
state "Figure A.B, created using Mathematica software, contains a plot 
of the variation of X with Y and Z" or something?

Overall: Reads very well and makes me realise just how hard 
experimentation can actually be in the modern world.  We're a long way 
beyond rolling balls down inclined planes and timing them with a steady 
human pulse (Galileo I think!).  The care and technique involved, and 
the need to *invent* when ready-made tools aren't there is great to see.

In some places I felt that you over-explained/over-complicated the 
discussion - e.g. the cryo-cooling bit (lines 2925+.  If you reject a 
methodology, do you really need to explain in huge detail why?  You are 
a scientist and made a rational decision based on the evidence.  No need 
to explain exactly why you did it except to say you did.  I felt 
similarly when you discussed temperature measurement techniques.  You 
chose thermocouple measurement for obvious and well-founded reasons.  It 
seems pointless to explain all the alternatives and why you rejected 
them (liquid-in-glass thermometers!!!).  Rather than a mass of detail 
about non-used techniques, could you simply say something like 
"Thermocouple temperature measurement was chosen based on criteria 
including size, accuracy, and digitisation of signal"???  You wrote the 
thesis using a computer/word-processor in English.  Your first chapter 
didn't discuss all the other writing techniques and why you rejected 
them.  You made a sound decision based on the evidence.  Nuff said!

Seriously though Niel, if you are submitting in a week, don't fret about 
this - it reads more than well enough, and too much is better than not 
enough!  Get it submitted - the sooner the better.  Just remember that 
you will ALWAYS get some minor corrections anyway.  It is far better to 
give the examiner a bunch of easily-correctably things to identify than 
to deliver a "perfect" thesis that will cause them to go searching for 
something serious to complain about in order to do their job!!!
==============================

Feel free to send me your accepted publication - can't promise I'll read 
it straight away, but always nice to have a copy.

Keep at it mate - almost there!  For me, the weekend starts here.  Have 
a good one.
