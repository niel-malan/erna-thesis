\begin{acknowledgements}

I gratefully acknowledge my supervisor, Prof Egmont Rohwer, who had the faith in
me to invite me to take on the project, and the patience to wait for me to
respond and the patience to wait for me to finish. I am extremely grateful for
the funding he supplied at the beginning of the project, when funding was a real
problem.

Dok Fanie (Dr SJ van der Walt) who was appointed as my co-supervisor, but was
also my predecessor, was willing to lend an ear and encourage, supply new ideas.

The various Deans who allowed me to re-register every year. 

I acknowledge my fellow students,
\begin{itemize} \item Kobie Smit lent a kind
ear to the laments, and helped me feel less alone.
\item Marc Bouwer, whose youthful energy proved to be highly contagious, spent
hours in front of the whiteboard with me, helping to clarify thoughts and
understanding basic science.
\item Elize Smit, who set me such a good example of academic performance. Thank goodness I didn't try to follow it. 
\item Linda Pretorius, whose PhD challenges made me grateful for the simplicity of my project. 
\item Nadine Broodryk for all the conversations.
\item My office mates, in no particular order: Sifiso Nsibande, Madelien Wooding, Kedibone Mashale, Portia
Makhubela, Chiedza Munyeza, Amanda \ldots, Genna-Leigh Geldenhuis,Margaux Lim-a-Tock, Leandri van der Wat
\end{itemize}

My father, Danie Malan, spent a lot of energy and time on being an instrument
maker for me.

My mother, Retha Malan, made sure that feeding and dressing myself during this
time was as simple as possbile.

Of course the project would not have been possible without the assistance from
the technical team at the University of Pretoria:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Our instrument maker, Nico van Vuuren, whose excellent work inspired me to
create designs worthy of that quality of work.

\item My thanks to David Masemula, who maintained the supply of gas cylinders.

\item Yvette Naudé has been a most kind and helpful lab manager.

\item Naomi Steenkamp is the most quietly effective financial administrator known to
man. Through her services purchasing supplies was a painless exercise.
\item Annetjie Kok and Ria Swart were our kindest

\item Antoinette ??insert surname of the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at
the University of Pretoria provided invaluable aid in performing the SEM images.

\end{itemize}

For Sunil Patel, who, in true hacker spirit, made the \LaTeX template this
document is based on freely avaiilable.

Our commercial suppliers also need acknowledgement. Beyers at Chemetrix, who
spent effort in keeping our outdated HP instrumentation running. For Agilent,
who supplied us with an excellent used intrument at a nominal cost. Restek, for
free columns. Reynard Heymans from FLIR recorded thermal videos of the
instrument in action without asking for a cent of money. For Neil Frame from
D.C. Wort, who supplied me with free material and offered valuable advice.

For Barbara Lotze, for whose support I will be eternally grateful. 

My mental health team who kept me sane. Johan Erasmus, whose professional
psychological help first guided me through clinical depression, and then was
crucial in getting me unstuck. Maria Ramaahlo at the Disability Unit was the
first person to offer concrete help with ADHD. Dr GP Grobler, my competent
psychiatrist, always offered interesting conversations, despite his limited
time. Dr Zuleikha Ahmed of Student Support treated me with the
utmost kindness, even when I was extremely angry. Dr Erna Gerryts, whose
conversations brought me back to reality. And of course the innumerable staff
members of Virgin Active Health Clubs who kept the gym going. 

 "Works well when under constant supervision and cornered like a rat in a trap."


Sasol Fuel, who saw the need for expertise, and started acting as a major
funding source. This freed up so many resources.

The financial assistance of the South African National Energy Research Institute
towards this research is hereby acknowledged. Opinions expressed and conclusions
arrived at, are those of the author and are not necessarily to be attributed to
SANERI.
