\begin{abstract}

The topic of this thesis is the development of comprehensively coupled
(supercritical fluid × gas) chromatography and its application to the chemical
analysis of biodiesel and biodiesel blends. A future low-carbon economy might
still have a need for large, high-efficiency diesel engines fuelled with a
high-quality carbon-neutral fuel such as biodiesel. The quality of fuels are
judged according to technical standards: documents that detail the requirements
of compliance. Liquid fuels are complex mixtures that challenge the separation
science used to ensure compliance. Chromatographic separations that use
different separation mechanisms can be combined to meet those challenges,
culminating in comprehensive coupling, where every fraction of a first
separation is subjected to a second separation. The greater the difference
between the separation mechanisms the more useful the comprehensive coupling.
The difference between between supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and gas
chromatography (GC) separation mechanisms is great and their coupling is
technically simple, but to make the coupling practical the GC separation must be
fast and temperature-programmed.  The construction of a  coaxial resistive
heater for short capillary columns with active cooling by liquid carbon dioxide
allows for hundreds of consecutive fast temperature programmed GC separations
which, if they are of fractions from an SFC separation, can be combined to
construct a two-dimensional SFC×GC chromatogram. When biodiesel and biodiesel
blends are analysed by SFC×GC, separation in the first dimension is by polarity
and degree of unsaturation and in the second dimension by volatility.
The resulting chromatograms contain powerful patterns of peaks, with the
aromatic hydrocarbons separated from the alkanes, and the fatty acid methyl
esters (FAMEs) of the biodiesel separated from the hydrocarbons of the
petrodiesel. Because the flame ionization detector (FID) is used, quantification
is straightforward and reliable. The FID remains compatible with SFC×GC even
when organic modifiers are added to the SFC mobile phase, because the modifiers
elute on the GC as a solvent peak, separate from the analytes of interest.
SFC×GC can be used for research and quality control in the liquid fuels and
vegetable oil industries.

I gratefully acknowledge my supervisor, Prof Egmont Rohwer, who had the faith in
me to invite me to take on the project, and the patience to wait for me to
respond and the patience to wait for me to finish. 

Dok Fanie (Dr SJ van der Walt) my predecessor, showed me how to be bold in the
lab. He was the giant on whose shoulders I stand.

I acknowledge my fellow students,
\begin{itemize} 
  
\item Kobie Smit lent a kind ear to the laments, and helped me feel less alone.

\item Marc Bouwer, whose youthful energy proved to be highly contagious. He
spent hours in front of the whiteboard with me, helping to clarify thoughts and
understand basic science.

\item Elize Smit, who set me such a good example of academic performance. Thank
goodness I didn't try to follow it.
 
\item Linda Pretorius, whose PhD challenges made me grateful for the simplicity
of my project.

\item Nadine Broodryk, for all the conversations.

\item My office mates, in no particular order: Sifiso Nsibande, Madelien
Wooding, Kedibone Mashale, Portia Makhubela, Chiedza Munyeza, Amanda Mahlangu,
Genna-Leigh Geldenhuis, Margaux Lim-a-Tock, Leandri van der Wat, Basil Mujanja,
Olu Adegoke, Hanieh Montaseri. Arriving at work was always pleasant.

\end{itemize}

My father, Danie Malan, spent time and energy and time on instrument making. My
mother, Retha Malan, ensured that I was fed and dressed. 

Of course the project would not have been possible without the assistance from
the technical team at the University of Pretoria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Our instrument maker, Nico van Vuuren, whose excellent work inspired me to
create designs worthy of that quality of work.

\item David Masemula, who maintained the supply of consumables.

\item Yvette Naudé, a most kind and helpful lab manager.

\item Naomi Steenkamp, the most quietly effective financial administrator known to
man. Through her services purchasing supplies was a painless experience.

\item Annetjie Kok and Ria Swart were the kindest administrators.

\item Antoinette of the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at the
University of Pretoria, provided invaluable aid in collecting the SEM images.

\item Dr Erna Gerryts, Faculty Academic Advisor, was my thesis writing manager.
This is a unique role, and she was uniquely qualified to fill it. This thesis
would not have been completed in time without her intervention.

\end{itemize}

I need to thank Dr Michael Denton and Therese Bron for reviewing and reading
this thesis and offering invaluable advice.

Our commercial suppliers also need acknowledgement. Beyers at Chemetrix, who
spent extra effort in keeping instrumentation running. Agilent supplied
us with an excellent used instrument at nominal cost. Restek provided us with a
set of HPLC columns at no cost. Reynard Heymans from FLIR recorded thermal
videos of the coaxial heater in action without asking for money. Neil Frame of
D.C. Wort supplied me with free samples and offered valuable advice.

Mathilda Mosterd of Precision Oils Laboratories Pty Ltd, provided me with
prepared samples and their fatty acid profiles, which afforded valuable
comparisons.

My mental health team kept me sane. Johan Erasmus, whose professional
psychological help first guided me through clinical depression, and then was
crucial in getting me unstuck. Maria Ramaahlo at the Disability Unit was the
first person to offer concrete help with ADHD. Dr GP Grobler, my competent
psychiatrist, always offered interesting conversations, despite his limited
time. Dr Zuleikha Ahmed of Student Support treated me with the utmost kindness,
even when I was extremely angry. And of course the innumerable staff members of
Virgin Active Health Clubs always made visiting their gym a very pleasant
experience.

Sasol Fuel and the NRF supported the laboratory through funding.

The financial assistance of the South African National Energy Research Institute
towards this research is hereby acknowledged. Opinions expressed and conclusions
arrived at, are those of the author and are not necessarily to be attributed to
SANERI.

Sunil Patel, in true hacker spirit, made the \LaTeX template this document is

%	PREFACE
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{preface}
\addchaptertocentry{\prefacename}

People learn from other people. In the academic environment, students formally
learn from professors and from trusted authors of academic writing. Less
formally, students also learn from other students and what other students
wrote, including dissertations and theses.

In the South African academic environment, students often lack a wide base of
knowledge: they survive a secondary education system that has the bare minimum
of resources, and then enter a highly-focused tertiary degree programme. When
they graduate, they are well-trained and knowledgeable in a narrow technical
field. They rarely had the time to obtain knowledge extending beyond their
formal academic programme.

This thesis was therefore written with the following audience in mind: A young
South African who has successfully passed through the South African school
system, has just obtained an Honours degree in chemistry at the University of
Pretoria, and is now embarking on a postgraduate degree. The thesis starts by
putting the scientific work strongly in context of history, society, and
technology before elaborating on the theoretical and technical work and finally
presenting the results obtained.
