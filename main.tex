\begin{acknowledgements}

I gratefully acknowledge my supervisor, Prof Egmont Rohwer, who had the faith in
me to invite me to take on the project, and the patience to wait for me to
respond and the patience to wait for me to finish. 

Dok Fanie (Dr SJ van der Walt) my predecessor, showed me how to be bold in the
lab. He was the giant on whose shoulders I stand.

I acknowledge my fellow students,
\begin{itemize} 
  
\item Kobie Smit lent a kind ear to the laments, and helped me feel less alone.

\item Marc Bouwer, whose youthful energy proved to be highly contagious, spent
hours in front of the whiteboard with me, helping to clarify thoughts and
understanding basic science.

\item Elize Smit, who set me such a good example of academic performance. Thank
goodness I didn't try to follow it.
 
\item Linda Pretorius, whose PhD challenges made me grateful for the simplicity
of my project.

\item Nadine Broodryk for all the conversations.

\item My office mates, in no particular order: Sifiso Nsibande, Madelien
Wooding, Kedibone Mashale, Portia Makhubela, Chiedza Munyeza, Amanda Mahlangu,
Genna-Leigh Geldenhuis, Margaux Lim-a-Tock, Leandri van der Wat, Basil Mujanja,
Olu Adegoke, Hanieh Montaseri.

\end{itemize}

My father, Danie Malan, spent time and energy and time on instrument making. My
mother, Retha Malan, ensured that I was fed and dressed. 

Of course the project would not have been possible without the assistance from
the technical team at the University of Pretoria:

\begin{itemize}
\item Our instrument maker, Nico van Vuuren, whose excellent work inspired me to
create designs worthy of that quality of work.

\item My thanks to David Masemula, who maintained the supply of consumables.

\item Yvette NaudÃ© is a most kind and helpful lab manager.

\item Naomi Steenkamp is the most quietly effective financial administrator known to
man. Through her services purchasing supplies supplies was a painless experience.

\item Annetjie Kok and Ria Swart were kindest administrators.

\item Antoinette of the Centre for Microscopy and Microanalysis at the
University of Pretoria provided invaluable aid in collecting the SEM images.

\item Dr Erna Gerryts, Faculty Academic Advisor, was my thesis writing manager.
This is a unique role, and she was uniquely qualified to fill it. The existence of this thesis

\end{itemize}

Our commercial suppliers also need acknowledgement. Beyers at Chemetrix, who
spent extra effort in keeping instrumentation running. For Agilent, who supplied
us with an excellent used intrument at a nominal cost. Restek provided us with a
set of HPLC columns at no cost. Reynard Heymans from FLIR recorded thermal
videos of the coaxial heater in action without asking for money. Neil Frame from
D.C. Wort supplied me with free samples and offered valuable advice.

Mathilda Mosterd of Precision Oils Laboratories Pty Ltd provided me with
prepared samples and their fatty acid profiles, which afforded valuable
comparisons.

My mental health team kept me sane. Johan Erasmus, whose professional
psychological help first guided me through clinical depression, and then was
crucial in getting me unstuck. Maria Ramaahlo at the Disability Unit was the
first person to offer concrete help with ADHD. Dr GP Grobler, my competent
psychiatrist, always offered interesting conversations, despite his limited
time. Dr Zuleikha Ahmed of Student Support treated me with the utmost kindness,
even when I was extremely angry. And of course the innumerable staff members of
Virgin Active Health Clubs always made visiting their gym a very pleasant
experience.

Sasol Fuel supported the laboratory through funding.

The financial assistance of the South African National Energy Research Institute
towards this research is hereby acknowledged. Opinions expressed and conclusions
arrived at, are those of the author and are not necessarily to be attributed to
SANERI.

Sunil Patel, in true hacker spirit, made the \LaTeX template this document is

%	PREFACE
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{preface}
\addchaptertocentry{\prefacename}

People learn from other people. In the academic environment, students formally
learn from professors and from trusted authors of academic writing. Less
formally, students also learn from other students, and what other students
wrote, including dissertations and theses.

In the South African academic environment, students often lack a wide base of
knowledge: they survive a secondary education system that has the bare minimum
of resources, and then enter a highly-focused tertiary degree programme. When
they graduate, they are well-trained and are knowledgeable in a narrow technical
field. They rarely have had the time to obtain knowledge extending beyond their
formal academic programme.

This thesis was therefore written with the following audience in mind: A young
South African who has successfully passed through the South African school
system, has just obtained an Honours degree in chemistry at the University of
Pretoria, and is now embarking on a postgraduate degree. The thesis starts by
putting the scientific work strongly in context of history, society, and
technology before elaborating on the theoretical and technical work and finally
presenting the results obtained.
