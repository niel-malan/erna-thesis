This thesis discusses the development of a comprehensively coupled
(supercritical fluid × gas) chromatograph and its application to the analysis of
biodiesel. The discussion on the experimental work divides naturally into two
parts: the previous chapter discusses the supercritical fluid chromatography
(SFC) and this chapter discusses the gas chromatography (GC).

\section{Speed of analysis}

In principle, comprehensively coupled chromatography (as discussed in Section
\ref{sec:SFCxGC}) could be performed by manually or mechanically collecting
equal-sized fractions from a \textsuperscript{1}D chromatograph, and then
injecting a portion of each fraction into a different (\textsuperscript{2}D)
chromatograph. This would meet all the criteria for comprehensively coupled
chromatography. In practice, such an approach would be slow, labour-intensive,
expensive, and error prone.

But reliable devices were invented that can repeatedly collect and re-inject
fractions of eluate \textit{while the \textsuperscript{1}D chromatograph is
still running}. These devices became known as \textit{modulators} and made
comprehensively coupled chromatography practical. Today GC×GC is an established
technique: the annual GC×GC Symposium is in its 15th year, and major reviews are
published regularly \autocite{Seeley2013, Prebihalo2018}.

In GC×GC the entire 2D chromatogram is finished within the duration of the
\textsuperscript{1}D run. This is made possible by using short, narrow bore
columns with thin-film stationary phases in the \textsuperscript{2}D separation,
which allows \textit{fast chromatography}.

In LC×GC and SFC×GC with packed \textsuperscript{1}D columns using stopped flow
modulation (as described in Section \ref{sec:stopflow}) the total run time can
be longer, but not indefinitely longer. Firstly, in dense mobile phases
diffusion is not zero, so the stopped-flow time should be minimized to prevent
unnecessary peak broadening. Secondly, total run times must be practical: while
it's not inconceivable to have experiments that run for days, complex
instrumentation can reliably run for such long periods is expensive.

The time it takes for a stopped-flow SFC×GC run can be calculated from

\[t_{T} = t_{SFC} + \frac{t_{SFC}}{t_{m}} \times t_{GC}\]

where \(t_T\) is the total time, \(t_{SFC}\) is the time the unmodulated SFC run
would take, \(t_m\) is the interval between sampling events (better known as the
\textit{modulation period}), and \(t_{GC}\) is the time for each GC run.

Examining the expression shows that we can decrease \(t_T\) by increasing
\(t_m\), but there is limit to this: if the modulation time becomes too long,
the separation obtained in the \textsuperscript{1}D separation might be lost,
which would mean it could no longer be considered comprehensively coupled
chromatography. So, the only way to decrease the total run times is to reduce
\(t_{GC}\), the GC run time.

For example, if a typical SFC run takes 20 minutes, and fractions are collected
for every 5 seconds of SFC run, it means there will be \( 20 \times 60 / 5 = 240
\) fractions collected. Each of these fractions must be injected into a GC
chromatograph. If each GC run took 1 minute, the SFC×GC run would last 240
minutes = 4 hours. Run times this long are not unheard of in analytical
chromatography, but deciding on them depends heavily on context.
Finding the proverbial biomarker for Alzheimer's disease would justify such a
long run time: routine quality control of a commodity biofuel would not.

This discussion should make it clear that for successful SFC×GC the GC
must be \textit{fast}.

\section{Fast gas chromatography theory}

The theory of fast gas chromatography has been well developed
\autocite{Blumberg1997}, and every chromatographer who has looked into faster
chromatography has met the chromatographer's trilemma (See Figure
\ref{fig:trilemma}): Any chromatographic method that involves decisions speed,
resolution, and capacity can maximize only one at a time\footnote{This trilemma
applies only to capillary chromatography. When using packed columns, the capacity
can be readily increased by using a column with a larger diameter and a larger
amount of packing.}. The fastest chromatogram will have low capacity and low
resolution, the highest resolution chromatogram will be slow and have low
capacity, and the chromatogram of a sample with a high concentration of analyte
will be slow and have low resolution \autocite{Klee2002}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Figures/Triangle.pdf}
\decoRule
\caption[Schematic diagram of a the chromatograher's trilemma.]{The chromatographer's trilemma.}
\label{fig:trilemma}
\end{figure}

We avoided the trilemma by not bothering with optimizing column capacity. Sample
capacity in capillary GC is a function of film thickness and column diameter. We
decided to use the workhorse of GC, the \SI{0.25}{\milli\metre} internal
diameter column with a \SI{0.25}{\micro\metre} film thickness. The stationary
phase was a proprietary cross-linked polysiloxane polymer (Restek
Rxi\textregistered{}-5Sil MS), designed to mimic the behaviour of a
\SI{5}{\percent} diphenyl/\SI{95}{\percent} dimethyl polysiloxane stationary
phase. With the phase ratio/column capacity fixed, the remaining trade-off is
between speed and resolution.

%The experienced chromatographer will know that there is only one optimum flow
%rate, the minimum of the Van Deemter curve \(\hat{h}=\frac{B}{u}+{C}{u}\), or under
%conditions of high pressure drop, the equivalent equation by Blumberg
%\autocite{Blumberg1997} \(\hat{h}=\frac{B}{\bar{u}^2} + C_1\bar{u}^2 +
%C_2\bar{u}\).

% Any attempt to increase the
% speed will lead to lower resolution: If the mobile phase flow rate is at an
% optimum, a shorter column will yield a lower void time, but the number of plates
% will be lower so the separation will not have the time to complete, resulting in
% decreased resolution. If the column length is kept constant but the flow is
% increased, the plate height will be greater, so the same length of column will
%have fewer plates, and hence decreased resolution.

If two peaks are satisfactorily separated on given column, it is not possible to
run a faster chromatogram with higher resolution.  This can be seen by examining
the resolution equation \autocite{Sandra1989}

\[ R_s = \left(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{4}\right)\left(\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha}\right)\left(\frac{k_2}{1+k_2}\right) \]

Where the \(N\) is the \textit{number of plates}, \(\alpha\) is the
\textit{selectivity}, and \(k_2\) is the \textit{retention factor}.

\(N\) is can be calculated from \(N = \frac{L}{H} \), where \(L\) is the
\textit{column length}, and \(H\) is the \textit{plate height}.

Therefore \( R_s \propto \sqrt{\frac{L}{H}} \), and obviously reducing the
length of the column will reduce the resolution \(R_s\). 

\( H \) depends on gas flow, in a relationship described by the \textit{Van
Deemter Equation} \( H = \frac{B}{\bar{u}} + {C}{\bar{u}} \) or, under
conditions of high pressure drop, the equivalent equation by Blumberg
\autocite{Blumberg1997} \( H = \frac{B}{\bar{u}^2} + C_1\bar{u}^2 +
C_2\bar{u}\), where \(\bar{u}\) is the average linear gas velocity in the
column, and the coefficients \(B\), \(C\), \(C_1\), and \(C_2\) are constants
relating to geometry and diffusion.
These equations do have minima, but under most experimental conditions the flow
will be at such a rate that increasing the flow will increase the plate height.
Hence, increasing the flow while keeping the same column length will decrease
the resolution \( R_s \).

% \[t_{R2} =16 {R_s}^2(\frac{\alpha}{\alpha - 1})^2 (\frac{(k_2 + 1)^3}{k_{2}^2)} \frac{H}{\bar{u}} \]
% where \[t_{R2}\] and \( \bar{u} \) is the average linear gas velocity.

For this reason, the chromatographic separation of compounds with limited
selectivity requires a long run time. For example, the official methods of
separating the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) found in biodiesel require
columns \SI{100}{\metre} long \autocite{AOCS2017} and run times of hours. These
systems have just enough theoretical plates to separate the chemically very
similar FAMEs

For any given column and sample, the only way to make GC separations faster is
to generate excess resolution. Fewer theoretical plates will then be necessary
to obtain an optimal resolution. Excess resolution can be obtained by increasing
the selectivity $\alpha$, or by selective detection (\textit{e.g.} an electron
capture detector). In practical terms this means using a column with a different
stationary phase or a different detector. A non-chromatographic way to generate
excess resolution is often termed \textit{sample clean-up}. While usually
considered part of sample preparation, it is an additional, pre-chromatographic
separation step that removes non-analyte compounds, so that only relevant
compounds need to be separated from each other.

%\begin{equation} 
%N_{req} = 16R^2_s\left[\frac{1+k}{k}\right]^2\left[\frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1}\right]^2
%\label{eqn:Nreq}
%\end{equation}

In SFC×GC excess resolution is generated in the \textsuperscript{1}D SFC
separation. Separating compounds by their group types first
\autocite{Venter2006} is a kind of sample preparation step, so that the
\textsuperscript{2}D GC separation --- in which separation is dominated by
volatility --- needs only resolve chemically similar peaks. The excess
resolution generated by the \textsuperscript{1}D SFC separation can be traded
for faster chromatography using shorter columns, higher flow rates, temperature
programming, or a combination of the above. Fortunately, the literature shows
that deciding which approach to follow does not invoke a dilemma, and the
recommendations are quite clear. It has been shown showed that superior
resolution is obtained when shorter columns are used rather than higher flow
rates \autocite{Klee2002}. In her thesis Gail Reed \autocite{Reed1999} compared
shorter columns against faster flow, and showed that shorter columns produce
superior results over faster flow.
Then she concluded:

\begin{quotation}

``Fast temperature programming should be used for fast GC rather than a smaller
internal diameter. Fast temperature programming has been largely underutilized;
however, new instrumentation will make it possible to more fully exploit fast
temperature programming rates. Fast temperature programming rates allow for the
use of short columns with normal internal diameters and film thicknesses which
makes sample capacity less of a problem for this mode of fast GC compared to
other means of fast GC.''

\end{quotation}

In line with this recommendation, the fast GC described in this chapter used a
short GC column (\SI{1}{\metre} long) that used a correspondingly fast
temperature program.

\section{Temperature programming}

Temperature programming is, of course, not necessary only for fast
chromatography, but has long been implemented to avoid the \textit{general
elution problem} \autocite[p. 779]{Skoog2007}. This problem can be summarized as
follows: in separations of complex mixtures, it becomes unlikely that one set
acceptable operating conditions (temperature, flow and stationary phase) will
give satisfactory (fast enough with acceptable resolution) separations for all
the compounds of interest. As discussed above, there is only one optimum flow,
and it is impractical to change the stationary phase during a run, so the only
parameter to change is the temperature.

The technology for temperature programming in GC is mature, and every column
manufacturer specifies temperature limits for isothermal and ramped temperature
programs for every stationary phase.

\section{Temperature ramp rates}
\label{sec:RampRates}
Early experimenters realized the importance of temperature control in GC, and
used vapour baths \autocite{Desty1957} or oil baths \autocite{Eggertsen1956} to
control temperature in their experiments, but they quickly realized that leaks
could allow oil into the column. Oil that entered the column would then
contaminate the stationary phase, rendering it useless. Therefore, in the
modern, conventional gas chromatograph the column is heated in an air bath with
very precise temperature control.

Blumberg and Klee \autocite{Blumberg2000} recommend that a good initial
temperature ramp rate is 10 C\textdegree{} per void time ($t_m$). For long
columns the void times are long, and the ramp rates can be low. As illustration,
Figure \ref{fig:RampRate7890B} shows the temperature ramp rates of a
state-of-the-art chromatograph. By contrast, for short, narrow-bore columns, the
ramp rate needs to be thousands of Celsius degrees per minute.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/7890B.png}
	\decoRule
	\caption[A temperature-rate table from the Agilent7890B data sheet]{The
	temperature-rate table from the Agilent 7890B chromatograph data sheet
	\autocite{7890B}. }
	\label{fig:RampRate7890B}
\end{figure}

The low ramp rate of conventional air baths is caused by three factors:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The low heat capacity of air
	\item The poor thermal conductivity of air
	\item The mass of the oven that needs to be heated. 
\end{itemize}

There is very little that can be done about these matters. It would be possible
to switch oven gas to hydrogen for higher thermal conductivity, and construct a
low-mass oven using, say, advanced resins for construction, but this would
probably involve significant safety and cost issues. What is required is a
complete redesign of the heating principle.

\subsection{Resistive heating}

Fortunately, the heating rate problem has a technologically simple solution,
\textit{resistive heating}\footnote{Alternative methods of heating by
electromagnetic fields are \textit{inductive heating} and \textit{dielectric
heating}.}. When a constant electric field is applied to a metal, the free electrons in
the metal will be accelerated by the electric field. But the electrons are
within the crystal lattice of the metal, where their mean free path is very
short. The electrons will therefore collide with atoms in the crystal lattice,
scattering inelastically. The energy lost in the inelastic collisions will
increase the vibrational frequency of atoms, and this energy will appear as
heat.

The number of electrons and their average (drift) speed in combination is
described by a measure called the \textit{current} ($I$), and the electric field
is can be described by the applied \textit{voltage} ($V$). The current $I$ is
proportional to the applied voltage, and the ratio $\frac{V}{I}$ defines a
proportionality constant $R$, called the resistance, which is a function of
conductor material and dimensions. The total power dissipated to heat ($P$) is
given by $P=IV$ or, equivalently, $P=I^2R$ or $P=\frac{R}{V^2}$.

Applying a voltage \(V\) to a metal element close to the column will heat the
metal, and therefore the column in contact with it. The rate at which the piece
of metal heats up depends on the power dissipated, the mass of the metal, and
its heat capacity. If the volume of the metal is small enough, and the current
high enough, the temperature of the metal element (and with it the temperature
of the column) will increase at a rate high enough to be useful in
chromatography. By suitable manipulation of \(V\), then, the temperature of the
column can then be changed at any desirable rate.

This technology has been reviewed \autocite{Wang2012, Jacobs2013, Miranda2010},
and a few technologies for resistive heating of capillary columns have emerged:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Direct heating of a metal column or a column coated with a metal layer
  \item Collinear heating
  \item Coaxial heating
\end{itemize}

The first SFC×GC work done \autocite{Venter2004} used a directly heated metal
column. While this approach proved the concept, experience showed two
shortcomings. Firstly, metallic columns are usually designed with specific
high-temperature applications in mind. This means that metal columns are not
available with all the stationary phases available in fused-silica columns.
Secondly, it was harder than expected to control the temperature accurately. The
temperature was determined by a thermocouple glued to the column, which was
sensitive to local variations.

An example of collinear resistive heating is Agilent\texttrademark{}'s
`low thermal mass' column, which includes collinear heating wire and a collinear
sensing element bundled with a short silica column. This approach requires that
the collinear heating element be wrapped in close contact with the column.

For the work presented in this thesis, a coaxial heater was used. This heater is
in the form of a thin-walled stainless-steel tube that carries the electric
current. It was made of a \SI{940}{\milli\metre} length of 304 stainless steel
with d an outside diameter of 1.06 mm and an inside diameter of 0.80 mm. The
column was threaded inside the stainless steel tube, which put it in close
contact with the heater, giving reliable heat transfer. The coaxial heater can be
coiled to fit inside a conventional GC oven.

This coaxial design has the advantage that the column can be changed without
changing the resistive heater. This means that there is no need to re-calibrate
the heater when columns are changed.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Column-Heater.pdf}
	\decoRule
	\caption[Coaxial heater resistance heater]{\label{fig:HeaterDiagram}Electric circuit diagram of the coaxial heater.}
\end{figure}

The electrical resistance of a conductor is determined by its dimensions, the
material it is made of, and the temperature of that material. In a conductor of
given dimensions, therefore, a knowledge of the resistance implies a knowledge
of the temperature. By following changes in the resistance, one can determine
changes in the temperature, and by comparing resistance at certain temperatures
with known temperatures, one can get a calibrated temperature from a given
resistance.

High-powered resistive heating implies low resistance. Measuring the
\textit{absolute value} of low resistance is technologically challenging
\autocite{Dyos2012}. But a simple electronic circuit can be used to
\textit{compare} the resistance of the coaxial heater with that of a reference
resistor (Figure \ref{fig:HeaterDiagram}). The circuit is supplied by a voltage
$V_{sup}$, in general an unknown value.
$V_{col}$ and $V_{ref}$ represents the voltage drop over the respective
resistors. Because the current $I$ through the circuit is the same for both
$R_{col}$ and $R_{ref}$, it is true that
$\frac{R_{col}}{V_{col}}=\frac{R_{ref}}{V_{ref}}$, and therefore

\begin{equation}R_{col} = R_{ref}\frac{V_{col}}{V_{ref}}
\end{equation}

The voltage drop across $R_{ref}$ is too small to be directly digitized,
therefore it is amplified by an amplifier with gain $g$, so that $V_b =
gV_{ref}$. $V_b$ is measured, as is $dV$, the potential difference between the
supply and the amplifier output. We can show that the coaxial heater resistance
\(R_{col}\) is a function of the voltage ratio \(frac{dV}{V_b}\).

First, 
\[ V_{sup} = V_{col} + V_{ref} \] 
but also
\[ V_{sup} = dV + V_b \]
Therefore,
\[ V_{col} + V_{ref} = dV + V_b \]
But \(V_{b} = g V_{ref}\), so
\[ V_{col} + V_{ref} = dV + gV_{ref} \]

\[ V_{col} = dV + gV_{ref} - V_{ref} \]

\[ V_{col} = dV + V_{ref}(g - 1) \]

\[ \frac{\displaystyle V_{col}}{\displaystyle gV_{ref}} = dV/gV_{ref} + V_{ref}(g-1)/gV_{ref} \]

\[\frac{\displaystyle V_{col}}{\displaystyle V_{ref}} = gdV/gV_{ref} + gV_{ref}(g-1)/gV_{ref} \]

\[\frac{\displaystyle V_{col}}{\displaystyle V_{ref}} = g\frac{dV}{V_b} + (g-1) \]

This proves that \( \frac{\displaystyle V_{col}}{\displaystyle V_{ref}} \) is a
linear function of $dV/V_b$. A quick check for correctness of the expression:
for a unity-gain amplifier $g = 1$, and $\frac{\displaystyle
V_{col}}{\displaystyle V_{ref}} = dV/V_b$.

Therefore 

\[ R_{col} = R_{ref} \left(\frac{g{dV}}{V_b} + (g-1) \right) \]

In practice the gain \(g\) might not be completely constant, but show a slight
dependence on \(dV\), so a general expression might be

\[ R_{col} = f\left(\frac{dV}{V_b} \right) \]


\section{Calibration}

The assumption is that the temperature is a function of the resistance of the
coaxial heater, or \( T = g(R_{col}) \). Because \( R_{col}=f(\frac{dV}{V_b} \),
we can see that \( T = g(f(\frac{dV}{V_b})) \), or, because a function \(g\) of
a function \(f\) is a function \(h\) (\(f \circ g = h \)), \( T =
h(\frac{dV}{V_b})) \).  Through a calibration procedure \(h{-1}\) can be
approximated by a polynomial or lookup table.

\subsection{Temperature uniformity}
\label{sec:Uniformity}

It is highly desirable that the coaxial heater should give uniform heating, but
there is no guarantee an electrically heated tube will heat uniformly, or will
not. We did not analyse the problem theoretically, but the following factors
will play a role:

\subsubsection{Resistivity's dependence on temperature}

The resistance of a metal increases with temperature. This means that if one
section of the coaxial heater should get hotter than the rest, it's resistance
will increase. If the current were to remain constant, more power would be
dissipated in this section (\(P=I^2R\)). If more power is dissipated, the
temperature will increase, leading to a higher resistivity, leading to higher
power dissipation, leading to a higher temperature, in a runaway cycle. In the
case of the supply voltage being held constant a higher resistance in one section
would mean a lower current overall, but still a higher power dissipation in the
section with higher temperature.

\subsubsection{Thermal conduction}

Each section of the coaxial heater is in thermal contact with its neighbours. If
it were to get hotter, the heat will flow from the hotter section to the cooler
neighbouring sections. This will tend to even out any temperature differences.

\subsubsection{Radiation}

An object radiates heat, which can be approximated by the Stefan-Boltzman law:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
	P=A \epsilon \sigma T^4
\end{equation}

where A is the surface area of the object, \(\epsilon\) is the
\textit{emissivity} of the surface, \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzman constant,
and \(T\) is the absolute temperature of the object. 

If a section of the coaxial heater were to become hotter than the other
sections, it would therefore radiate more heat. The increased power dissipation
by the higher resistance will therefore be partially offset by a higher
radiation. This will tend to moderate temperature differences.

\subsubsection{Convection}

When a part of the coaxial heater is hot, it will heat the air around it,
through radiation and conduction. This air might then move, through buoyancy or
any other force, past another part of the coaxial heater. This second part could
then be heated up by the transported air. For example, a vertically mounted
coaxial heater can be expected to develop a temperature gradient from bottom to
top, as natural convection lets hot air transfer heat from the lower end of the
heater to the upper end. In this way temperature gradients could be established
and maintained.

\subsubsection{Examining thermal uniformity by imaging}

The effect of the combination of resistivity's temperature dependence, thermal
conduction, radiation, and convection on the temperature uniformity of the
coaxial heater could be mathematically or numerically modelled, but such an
endeavour would fall outside the scope of this project. Experience had not led
us to expect any significant temperature non-uniformity, but we welcomed the 
opportunity to get empirical confirmation.

\textit{Thermal imaging} is the process by which infrared radiation from objects
can be captured in a photographic process. At near-ambient temperatures objects
emit copious amounts of infrared radiation, and higher the temperature, the more
is emitted. (See Equation \ref{eq:1}.) Specialized optics and sensors allow the
capture of that radiation in a camera, which can produce an image of a scene
that shows objects based on their surface temperature. The technological
capability of thermal imaging has improved markedly over the past years.

Using a FLIR{\texttrademark} T660 thermal imaging camera we obtained a video of
the coaxial heater executing a temperature ramp. This camera uses a \num{640 x 480}
focal plane uncooled bolometer array as a detector, which is sensitive to
radiation in the range \SI{7.5}{\micro\metre} to \SI{14}{\micro\metre}.
Figure \ref{fig:ThermalImageSetup} shows the setup used to record the thermal
video.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/ThermalImageSetup}
	\decoRule
	
\caption[A photograph of the setup used to record the thermal video]{This
photograph shows the setup used to record the termal video.}
	
	\label{fig:ThermalImageSetup}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ThermalImage} is a frame from the video, analysed to give
estimates of the temperatures on spots on the coaxial heater. The maximum
temperature difference between any two points is \SI{17.5}{\celsius}, and there
are no marked gradients.

\caption[A thermograph of the coaxial heater at temperature]{A thermograph of
the coaxial heater at high temperature. It shows that there are no runaway hot
spots.}
	
	\label{fig:ThermalImage}
\end{figure}

This examination of the uniformity of the coaxial heater put to rest any fears
that unexpected temperature gradients would interfere with the fast gas
chromatography.

\subsection{Temperature calibration}

When doing temperature-programmed gas chromatography it is desirable to have an
absolute measurement of the column temperatures. This makes it possible to
translate and compare methods between instruments. It was therefore necessary to
calibrate the temperature of the coaxial heater. Calibration is the comparison
of measurement values from a device under test with those of a calibration
standard of known accuracy. In the case of the temperature calibration of the
coaxial heater, it means comparing the results of the temperature as measured by
the coaxial heater with a standard temperature.

The problems of measuring a temperature inside a tube with a bore of
\SI{0.8}{\milli\metre} are not trivial.

The following temperature measurement technologies exist:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Liquid-in-glass thermometers
	\item Sealed liquid or gas sensing instruments and bimetallic sensors.
	\item Electrical resistance temperature measurement using metallic sensors
	\item Thermistors and semiconductors
	\item Thermoelectric temperature measurement
	\item Disappearing filament optical pyrometer
	\item Photoelectric optical pyrometers
	\item Total radiation pyrometers.
\end{itemize}

Liquid-in-glass thermometry would not be applicable because of the size of the
devices, and because they don't give a desirable electrical signal. 

In recent years the technology for measuring temperature by radiant energy
methods have improved markedly and has become affordable, in the form of thermal
cameras. However, at lower temperatures the accuracy of the recorded temperature
depends heavily on the emissivity of the measured material. Thermal imaging will
also only measure the outside wall surface temperature of the heater, and not
the temperature on the inside of the coaxial heater. So, while thermal imaging
settled questions about heater uniformity (Section \ref{sec:Uniformity}), it was
not considered ready to serve as a calibration standard. 

This leaves us with resistance temperature measurement with metallic sensors,
thermistors and semiconductors, and thermoelectric temperature measurement.

Electrical resistance measurement using metallic sensors might have been
feasible, if sensing elements of the appropriate dimensions were commercially
available. A further difficulty with this method of temperature measurement is
that long, thin conductors would be needed to connect the sensing element to the
electronics. These conductors would add to the resistance measured by the
sensing element, requiring complex correction or multi-wire measuring methods.

Thermistor and semiconductor devices could, in principle, be made small enough
for the job, but commercially available devices come in 'packages' that are too
large. Besides, the temperature range used in GC (\SI{-50}{\celsius} to
\SI{400}{\celsius}) does not fall inside the operating temperature range
specified by manufacturers of semiconductor devices (\SI{-55}{\celsius} to
\SI{125}{\celsius} for military applications).

Thermoelectric temperature measurement then remains, and was used to calibrate
the coaxial heater. In particular, the \textit{Seebeck effect} was exploited,
which is the observation that a temperature gradient imposed on a metallic
conductor will generate an electrical potential along the gradient. Therefore, a
circuit of two dissimilar metallic conductors will generate a voltage when there
is a temperature gradient along the conductors. The voltage generated is a
function of the temperature difference between the hot junction of the two
metals and their cold junctions at the voltmeter. Such a pair of dissimilar
conductors used to generate a voltage is known as a \textit{thermocouple}.
Thermocouple technology is mature and widely used in industry for measuring
temperatures. Thermocouples are usually constructed from well-characterized
alloys that generate predictable voltages for given junction temperatures.
Thermocouple alloys that have been standardized are known as 'types'. We
selected the general-purpose Type K thermocouple.
Thermocouple wire can be purchased in varying gauges, down to
\SI{25}{\micro\metre} in diameter, and the signal processing for thermocouple
signals have been standardized.

According to McGee \autocite{McGee1988} thermocouple junctions can be made by
welding, crimping, soft soldering, hard soldering, bolting, or simply twisting
the wires together.

Because of the temperature range expected to be measured ({-}50 \si{\celsius} to
400 \si{\celsius}) the option of soft soldering does not apply, because soft
solders have melting points around \SI{200}{\celsius}. The possibility of
corrosion and mechanical vibration suggest that twisting the wires together
will not form a reliable joint, and of course there are no sub-millimetre bolts
on the market.

This leaves welding, crimping and hard soldering as methods for making
thermocouple junctions. The option of crimping was not explored, chiefly because
there are no devices that can crimp hair-fine wire. Our knowledge of crimping
shows another problem: the final crimped connection has a diameter many times
the diameter of the wire. This precludes the application of crimping in this
context.

Hard soldering is usually done with high-temperature flames, and on contact the
flames will rapidly burn the fine wires. The temperature required for hard
soldering is still lower than the melting point of the wires, so that hard
soldering is not excluded, but we did not have the knowledge or the technology
to solve the associated problems.

Welding was found to be an accessible technology for forming small, reliable
joints in fine thermocouple wire.

\subsection{Thermocouple Welding}

Welding is the process of joining two metal parts by melting a portion of each
part, allowing the molten metals first to mix, and then to solidify. This
creates a permanent joint between the two metals. Welding is widely practised as
an industrial process in applications ranging from shipbuilding to
microelectronics.

Various sources of heating can be used, and we decided to use electricity. A
\SI{24}{\volt} direct current, adjustable bench power supply was used to supply
the current. The two wires of the thermocouple were twisted together, and the
twisted pair was connected to one pole of the power supply. A carbon electrode
was connected to the other pole. The carbon electrode was carefully brought
closer to the thermocouple pair until a spark jumped across the air gap. When
the spark turned into an arc the heat of the arc melted the end of the twisted
pair. The molten metal would then contract into a spherical globule, which grew
as the arc added more heat. As more of the metal of the wire melted, the globule
would move away from the carbon electrode, until the gap became too large to
sustain the arc. The current would then stop, leaving a spherical welded bead at
the end of the wires. (See Figure \ref{fig:WeldingSteps}.) The process could be
repeated as often as necessary to obtain a bead of the desired size.

It is worth noting that it is necessary to form an arc: if the carbon
electrode happened to touch the wire so that a current flowed directly from the
wire to the carbon electrode the wire would rapidly heat up over its length, and
melt. It is also interesting to note that it seemed necessary to have a roughly
broken carbon electrode surface: a polished surface would not generate an arc,
or even make electrical contact with the wires. This might be because the
graphite used for the electrode was formulated for use in pencils.

The apparatus used to do the welding is depicted in Figure
\ref{fig:FineWireWelder}, and Figure \ref{fig:TCWeldMicro} shows the image seen
through the microscope when the welding is done.

electrode from the negative base. The carbon electrode can be advanced towards

\subsection{Thermocouple probe construction}

To measure the temperature inside the coaxial heater required the thermocouple
had to be inserted into the coaxial heater. For this a fused silica capillary
with an inside diameter of \SI{0.25}{\milli\metre} and an outside diameter of
\SI{0.4}{\milli\metre} was used to construct a probe. (These capillaries were
easily obtained in the form of worn-out chromatographic columns.) A narrower
capillary was used to draw the wires through the probe capillary, in a process
described in Figure \ref{fig:FineWireThermocouple}. The wires could then be
welded to form a thermocouple, and then drawn into the probe capillary to the
desired position.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Thermocouple interfacing}

The Type K thermocouple has a sensitivity of approximately
\SI{41}{\micro\volt\per\celsius}. This means the voltage generated at the
temperature range of interest is too small to be conveniently digitized, and so
needs to be amplified. Because the Type K thermocouple is so commonly used in
industry, amplifiers have been developed specifically for thermocouple signal
conditioning. We chose the AD595 integrated circuit amplifier. The component's
data sheet explains its application concisely: ``The AD595 is a complete
instrumentation amplifier and thermocouple cold junction compensator on a
monolithic chip. It combines an ice point reference with a pre-calibrated
amplifier to produce a high level (10 mV/°C) output directly from a thermocouple
signal.'' \autocite{AD595} The output of the AD595 can be directly digitized and
fed to the computer.

\subsection{Calibration procedure}

The International Vocabulary of Metrology \autocite{JCGM200:2012} define
\textit{calibration} as ``[an] operation that, under specified conditions, in a
first step, establishes a relation between the \textbf{quantity values} with
\textbf{measurement uncertainties} provided by \textbf{measurement standards}
and corresponding \textbf{indications} with associated measurement uncertainties
and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for
obtaining a \textbf{measurement result} from an indication.''

In the first step of calibration, the \textbf{quantity values} used in the
calibration was the temperature value of the thermocouple probe as provided by
the thermocouple voltage, the AD595 amplifier, the digitization and the
subsequent calculations according to the AD595 data sheet. The
\textbf{measurement standards} were the known responses of the thermocouple
\autocite{Ripple1995}, the amplifier and the digitization system. The
\textbf{indication} was the voltage ratio \(\frac{dV}{Vb}\). As this was a first
attempt a calibration, \textbf{measurement uncertainties} were omitted.

To calibrate the coaxial heater, the heater and its assembly was installed in
the oven of the Varian 3300 GC, as it would be when in use. The detector was
removed, and the thermocouple probe was threaded through the detector stem,
through the heated T-piece block, and into the coaxial heater. The probe was
inserted so far that the thermocouple junction was about half-way between the
inlet end and the detector end of the coaxial heater.

When the system was set up as it would be in use, the coaxial heater was cooled
down, and a power ramp applied. The temperature of the thermocouple was
recorded, together with the voltages \(dV\) and \(Vb\). A curve could then be
plotted of thermocouple temperature \(T_{TC}\) against the voltage ratio \(
\frac{dV}{V_b} \) (Figure \ref{fig:CalibrationCurve}). This revealed the shape of
the function \(T(\frac{dV}{Vb})\), and completed the first step of the
calibration.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/2019_07_12_B-spline_fit_CPlot.pdf}
	\decoRule
	\caption[Calibration curve of the coaxial heater]{Calibration curve for the coaxial heater.}	
	\label{fig:CalibrationCurve}
\end{figure}

The second step of a calibration is to establish a \textbf{measurement result}
from an \textbf{indication}. It would be traditional to fit a mathematical
function such as a polynomial to the curve, but a numerical method was chosen
instead. We fitted a B-spline to the curve, and extracted coordinates on the
curve from the B-spline (See Figure \ref{fig:MeasurementCurve}). An
interpolation function was then used to obtain the measurement result \(T\) from
the indication \(dV/V_b\).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/2019_07_12_B-spline_fit_PPlot.pdf}
	\decoRule
	\caption[Measurement curve of the coaxial heater]{Measurement curve for the coaxial heater.}	
	\label{fig:MeasurementCurve}
\end{figure}

The calibration could be checked by setting the current through the coaxial
heater to a minimum, at which not enough heat is generated to affect its
temperature. Then the oven of the Varian 3300 GC could be set to a range of
different temperatures. Once equilibrium was reached the reported temperature of
the coaxial heater and the air bath temperature could be compared, and
adjustments could be made to the calibration

\subsection{Cold spots}
\label{sec:ColdSpots}

For the fastest temperature programming with resistive heating the heating
element should be as light as possible and carry the largest necessary current.
The current doing the heating must be carried to the coaxial heater using a feed
conductor. To prevent the feed conductor from heating up it must have a low
resistance, and this low resistance is achieved by making the conductor as
'thick' or as 'heavy' as necessary, meaning that it is constructed of a material
with a high mass per unit length.

Good electrical metallic conductors are invariably also good thermal conductors,
and therefore, the area around the junction of the feed conductor to the coaxial
heater will always have a lower temperature than the nominal temperature of the
heater. In capillary GC this is undesirable: a cold spot in a column can wreak
havoc with retention times and peak shapes.

Conversely, if an attempt is made to reduce the contact area between the feed
conductor and the thin material of the coaxial heater, a hot spot might develop,
which could burn a hole in the coaxial heater tube or damage the column.

The electrical connection between the feed conductor and the coaxial heater was
therefore designed in the form of an externally heated block. This block was
kept at a higher temperature than the highest expected temperature of the
chromatographic temperature program. This prevented the formation of cold spots
in the coaxial heater, which might lead to cold spots in the column, while also
offering a large contact area so that hot spots do not develop. Each end of the
coaxial heater therefore ended in one of two heated blocks, where it was brazed
in place. Each block had a brass tail, to which an electric feed-wire was
soft-soldered. Each block was heated by four \SI{100}{\watt}
Hotset\texttrademark{} electrical cartridge heaters, with dimensions of \SI{6.5
x 40}{\milli\metre}. The cartridge heaters were switched on and off by solid
state relays controlled from the computer. The temperature of the block was
monitored through a thermocouple mounted in blind hole and the amount of power to
the heaters was controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) implemented in
software.
 
\subsection{Cold column}
\label{sec:ColdColumn}

In a cold GC stationary phase, the retention factor \(k'\) is very high. This
means that the analytes migrate slowly relative to the mobile phase. The lower
the temperature, the higher \(k'\) becomes, so that for very low temperatures
the migration of the analyte becomes negligible. In effect, the analytes are
'trapped'. This trapping, also called \textit{cryo-trapping} or
\textit{cryo-focusing} is useful in various aspects of gas chromatography, such
as two-stage thermal desorption or thermal modulation in GC×GC. 

%In one such
%application a programmable temperature vaporizing inlet (PTV) was used to trap
%complex hydrocarbon fractions from an SFC for injecting into a GC×GC system
%\autocite{Potgieter2013}.

In the SFC×GC instrument described here, cryo-trapping was used as the second
stage of a two-stage modulator. (The stop valve described in Section
\ref{sec:stopflow} represents the first stage.) The column was cooled down to
very low temperatures, which trapped any analytes eluting from the first
dimension in a narrow band on the GC column. Once the required amount of
fraction had been collected, the eluate flow from the first dimension was be
stopped by closing the stop valve. Then the temperature ramp of the fast GC
would start. As the coaxial heater warmed up the column the values of \(k`\)
would decrease, and the analytes would start migrating.

The first SFC×GC chromatograph cooled the column by using the cryo-cooling
function of the Varian 3300 GC \autocite{Venter2004, Venter2003}. The purpose of
this function is to cool the GC column to sub-ambient temperatures, and is
needed when analysing volatile compounds. In such cases the \(k'\) values
at or near room temperature are too low to provide adequate retention, and the
cryo-cooling function permits temperature programs to start at sub-ambient
temperatures.

The Varian 3300 cryo-cooling function works by injecting liquid carbon dioxide
into the column oven. The evaporating liquid carbon dioxide absorbs energy from the
air, which lowers the temperature of the air in the oven. A control system
controls the amount of carbon dioxide admitted and the amount of heat added
through the oven heaters, thereby keeping the oven at the required temperature.

While the cryo-cooling function can cool down an oven to cryo-trap analytes,
there are two reasons why it is not a suitable method for practical trapping in
SFC×GC. The first reason is the quantity of coolant required: doing SFC×GC runs
revealed that about \SI{15}{\kilogram} of carbon dioxide was consumed per run. A
standard cylinder of carbon dioxide contains \SI{33}{\kilogram}, which implies
that a new cylinder would be required every two runs. Such a rate of use is much
too high for the intended application of the instrument. The second reason using
the GC oven's cryo-cooling function was not suitable for SFC×GC is that it is
much too slow. The time spent on cooling the oven and the column is time that
cannot be spent doing separations, and cooling a conventional GC oven takes a
lot of time: the Varian 3300's cryo-cooling function took \SI{30}{\second} to
cool the column down to a low starting temperature. A commercial
forced-convection system (``GC Chaser'' supplied by Zip Scientfic) improves cool
down time of an Agilent 6890 GC oven, taking 7 minutes instead of 16, cooling
down the oven from \SI{350}{\celsius} to \SI{30}{\celsius}. Cooling the
column in an air bath has the same drawbacks of low conductivity and low heat
capacity as air-bath heating has (see Section \ref{sec:RampRates}).

A system was therefore developed by which liquid carbon dioxide is injected from
one end into the space between the column and its coaxial heater. The other end
is open to the atmosphere. When the valve opens the pressure of the carbon
dioxide drops from \SI{55}{atm} in the cylinder to \SI{1}{atm} in the atmosphere
and the liquid starts to boil, absorbing large quantities of heat from the
surrounding column and coaxial heater in the process, so that their temperatures
decrease rapidly. This system solves the speed and coolant quantity problems:
because the coolant is in direct contact with the parts that need to be cooled,
the cooling is rapid, and because the coolant is applied where it is needed,
only a small quantity is required.

The carbon dioxide for cooling the coaxial heater was introduced through the
same heated block that provided the electrical connection. (See Section
\ref{sec:ColdSpots}.) A T-piece design allowed the liquid carbon dioxide to be
admitted to the end of the coaxial heater, which was brazed to the block. A
micro-union brazed to the block sealed the column's exit port, and the liquid
carbon dioxide entered along the side of the T (Figure \ref{fig:ManifoldDims}
and Figure \ref{fig:ManifoldAssy}). A metering valve allowed the flow rate of
the coolant to be adjusted, and a solenoid valve could switch the flow on or off
under computer control.

\subsubsection{Cryogen supply}

The carbon dioxide for cooling was supplied as by Afrox, in high-pressure
cylinders each containing 33kg of technical grade carbon dioxide. Each cylinder
was internally equipped with a \textit{dip tube}, a tube that extends from the
valve at the top of the cylinder to the bottom of the cylinder. This ensures
that when the valve is opened, liquid carbon dioxide is delivered.

Experience taught that for repeatable cooling, the source of liquid carbon
dioxide had to be near the solenoid valve. If this was not the case, when the
valve was opened initially only carbon dioxide gas would be admitted, followed
by a mixture of gas and liquid, and only finally liquid. (This is similar to the
common experience of opening a water tap after a municipal water supply
interruption: a lot of gurgling and spitting before a reliable stream of water
flows from the tap.) Such unreliable coolant flow leads to unreliable cooling.
To solve this problem we installed a reservoir for liquid carbon dioxide on top
of the GC. The problem of filling a receptacle with liquid carbon dioxide was
described in Section \ref{sec:CO2Pump}. The final design of the reservoir took
the form of a coil of copper tube immersed in a circulating coolant (Figure
\ref{fig:CryogenReservoir}). Mounting the reservoir above the cut-off valve
allows the liquid to collect at the bottom and allow gas to collect at the top,
so that when the valve opens the flow into the coaxial heater contains only
liquid.

\subsection{Column mounting}

The T-piece blocks described above (see Section \ref{sec:ColdSpots}, Section
\ref{sec:ColdColumn} and Figure \ref{fig:ManifoldAssy}) acted as electrical
connection for the coaxial heater and as injection point for coolant. The block
is heavy compared to the coaxial heater and column, and also has to absorb the
forces of the coolant inlet tube and the electrical connections. The column runs
from the heated inlet/detector to the heated T-piece block, and in between it
should not be exposed to any low-temperature cold spots, therefore the gap
between the T-piece block and the inlet/detector should be quite small, but the
gap cannot be zero, because electrical isolation needs to be maintained.
Also fused-silica capillary columns are fragile, and misalignment causes them to
break. Therefore, mechanically stiff and accurate mounting was needed for the
T-piece blocks, to allow the precise but adjustable alignment of the T-piece
blocks with the inlet/detector.

The final design for mounting the T-piece blocks was a pair of parallel rails.
These rails were held in place in the Varian 3300 oven by friction, so that they
could be adjusted and removed as necessary, yet was stiff enough to transfer the
necessary forces without deflecting. The pointed ends of the rails pressed
against a solid aluminium plate used as the floor of the oven, and at the top
adjustable points pressed against pressure plates which pressed against the roof
of the oven. Figure \ref{fig:RailsDrawing} shows a technical drawing of the
rails as designed.

The T-piece blocks were the electrical connections for the resistive coaxial
heater, which meant they needed to be electrically isolated, but they were also
heated, which meant that the insulation had to be resistant to heat. A
commercially available material that met these requirements was found in the
form of \textit{silicon mica}, a composite material of mica and a silicone
resin. This material has a continuous operating temperature of at least
\SI{500}{\celsius}, making it ideally suited to GC applications. The silicon
mica is also machinable, and can easily be shaped to the required design. 

The T-piece blocks were mounted on a pair of cars riding on the round-bar rails.
Each car was designed as a sandwich of plates of stainless steel and silicon
mica around a pair of brass bushes. Once assembled, the cars offered a set of
studs on to which the user could fit and bolt down the T-piece blocks. The
positions of the cars were determined by a locking collar on one of the rails.
Figure \ref{fig:CarsDrawing1} shows technical drawings of the cars that explains
the design.


\subsection{Heating control}

The amount of electrical power supplied to the coaxial heater was controlled by
a bank of six PNP 2N2955 transistors, connected in parallel to distribute their
heat dissipation. The final control signal was a voltage set either by a
potentiometer from the front panel, or by the computer. An operational amplifier
adjusted the current through the coaxial heater circuit so that a portion of the
voltage applied to the coaxial heater was equal to the set-point voltage. By
varying the set-point voltage the current through the coaxial heater can be
controlled to provide any desired amount of heat (\(P = I^2R\)).

\subsubsection{Temperature monitoring}

Independent of the amount of power dissipated in the coaxial heater, the current
through the reference resistor was compared to the current through the column.
This ratio corresponds to the resistance of the coaxial heater. This resistance
is a function of the temperature of the heater. Through the calibration
procedure described earlier, the temperature of the coaxial heater can be
calculated. The computer can do this fast enough so that a temperature
measurement is available to continuously feed to a control system. 

\subsubsection{PID tuning}

A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller was used to calculate the
amount of power necessary to keep the temperature of the coaxial heater as close
to the temperature set point as possible. The temperature set-point, in turn,
was given by the desired chromatographic temperature ramp.

The process of determining the best calculation by the PID is called
\textit{tuning}, and usually consists of determining the optimum values of a few
parameters. Tuning PID controllers is a complex sub-discipline of process
engineering, and outside the scope of this project, but for practical purposes
we used a privately published step-by-step tuning method \autocite{Peacock2008}
which is a version of the Cohen-Coon tuning method.

Figure \ref{fig:LoopTuning} shows the effect of an improved loop tuning. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/LoopTuningGraph.pdf}
	\decoRule	
	\caption[Effect of controller tuning]{An illustration of effective PID
	controller tuning. The trace (a) represents the set point change over time and
	includes a step change. (b) Before tuning the temperature overshoots and then
	undershoots the step change in the set point. (c) After the controller has been
	tuned the overshoot in response to a step change in the set point is minimized. }
	\label{fig:LoopTuning} 
\end{figure}

A properly tuned heater helps to improve the repeatability of the chromatography
through reliable temperature programs and prevents damage to the column due
overheating during set point overshoots.

\subsubsection{Heating rates}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:RampRates}, for fast temperature-programmed gas
chromatography the ramp rate needs to be in the order of thousands of degrees
Celsius per minute.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/high_rate_heating.pdf}
	\decoRule
		
	\caption[Heating rate illustration]{A graph of 9 identical, consecutive
	temperature ramps overlaid. The heating rate is \SI{4000}{C\degree\per\minute}.
	The temperature follows the set point faithfully up to \SI{350}{\celsius}.}

	\label{fig:4000K/min} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:4000K/min} illustrates heating ramps executed by the coaxial
heater. The heating rate was \SI{4000}{C\degree\per\minute}, and there are no
significant differences between the 9 consecutive ramps.

\subsubsection{Cooling rates}

The project did not demand a precise knowledge of, or control over, the cooling
rate of the coaxial heater. The only requirement was that cooling should be as
fast as possible. The cooling rate could be adjusted through the metering valve,
and an optimum cooling rate of \SI{5100}{C\degree\per\min} was achieved with a
carbon dioxide flow rate of around \SI{30}{\gram\per\min}. This allowed the
column to be cooled down from \SI{350}{\celsius} to \SI{-20}{\celsius} in about
2 seconds. At this rate the portion of the chromatographic cycle that is not
used for separation is dominated by fraction collection, and further cooling
rate increases will not significantly reduce run times.

\section{Detector}

The detector used in this fast GC was an unmodified Varian\texttrademark{} 3300
flame ionization detector (FID). The detector bias voltage was supplied by the
original electronics, but a stand-alone high-speed electrometer (V.G. Micromass
Ltd, Model M406-H) captured the signal, which was then conditioned by a
bench-top amplifier (V.G. Micromass Ltd, Model M406) before it was sent to the
computer. This electrometer and amplifier were fast enough to detect and amplify
the signals generated by the fast GC.

\section{Data acquisition and control software}

The whole SFC×GC instrument was controlled from a single PC, running a single
program. The program was written in LabVIEW 7.1\texttrademark{} (National
Instruments). This software was designed to interact very easily with the
National Instruments PCI-6014 multifunction data acquisition board.

LabVIEW is a \textit{visual programming language}, so called because programs
are created by manipulating icons and wires on a screen, instead of typing text.
This visual aspect of it makes it very easy to develop user interfaces as
\textit{virtual instruments} and get quick results. Figure \ref{fig:SFCGCFastVI}
shows the interface of the program used to control the SFC×GC instrument.

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}


\section{Data structure}

In GC×GC, 2D data is recorded as a continuous FID output stream --- as if it is
a 1D GC chromatogram --- and later converted into a 2D chromatogram using
knowledge of the modulation period. For two reasons we could not use this
approach. First, in our instrument the first (SFC) dimension runs in a
stop-flow mode making continuous data recording inappropriate. Second, the
duration of the cooling cycle varies, which would introduce unacceptable
variation in \textsuperscript{2}D retention times.

We therefore constructed 2D chromatograms by recording a GC run for each SFC
fraction injected. The \textsuperscript{1}D
retention times were recorded as the start times of each individual GC run.
The \textsuperscript{2}D retention times were measured from
the time the GC fast temperature program started. 

\section{Data visualization}
For data visualization we used the technical computing system Wolfram
Mathematica 11.3\texttrademark{}. Mathematica is an extremely powerful and broad
system, and we found it useful for its data manipulation and visualization
tools.

The collected data could be handled in different ways. One way was to split it
up into separate GC runs. Each individual GC run and its associated data could
then be examined using the \texttt{Manipulate[]} function (Figure
\ref{fig:SingleGC}).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./Figures/Manipulate.pdf}
	\decoRule
	
	\caption[A single fast GC chromatogram ]{A single fast GC chromatogram, in a
	Mathematica \texttt{Manipulate[]} environment. The sliders can be used to select
	the which GC run to view, and which data of that run. }
	
	\label{fig:SingleGC}
\end{figure}

Then the data could be re-arranged into a list of three-element lists, with
$^1$D retention time, $^2$D retention time, and detector signal as the elements
of the inner lists. The Mathematica functions \texttt{List3DPlot[]} and
\texttt{ContourPlot[]} could then be used to plot 3D chromatograms (Figure
\ref{fig:2DChromatogram}) or contour plots (Figure \ref{fig:Contourplot})
respectively.
