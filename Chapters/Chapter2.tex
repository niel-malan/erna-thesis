\section{The chemical industry}

Industrialized societies depend on chemicals. (In this discussion I define
chemicals as pure substances that are produced by industry for industry.)
Chemicals might be used in the processing of products, or blended with other
chemicals in formulations that might be sold to users as products. In a familiar
example, Sucrose is a chemical produced by the sugar industry from sugar cane or
sugar beet. It is a pure substance that is mostly used in the industry
as an ingredient for processed food. Other uses of sugar include coatings for
medication, and feedstock for engineered micro-organisms that produce
pharmaceuticals. (Sucrose is a rare example of a chemical that is also sold to
consumers.)
 
The chemical industry produces a huge variety of products, from compounds as
simple as hydrochloric acid to compounds as sophisticated as cyanocobalamin
(Figure \ref{fig:vitb12}). All of these chemicals help produce the products
indispensable to industrialized societies. Nevertheless, the chemical industry
is not held in high regard by people outside the industry. A part of this
negative perception comes from the chemical industry's reputation for fatal
accidents and pollution \autocite{Gumm2015}.

vitamin B12. This compound is produced on the tonne scale by the chemical
industry.}

\end{figure}

The list of incidents is long and examples easily spring to mind: In 1984 a leak
at a chemical plant in Bhopal, India, caused the death of thousands of people
and the injury of thousands more \autocite{Varma2005}.
Stratospheric ozone is struggling to recover from depletion caused by the
reckless emissions of chlorofluorocarbons \autocite{Ball2018}. Plastic
microparticles are now found everywhere in the oceans \autocite{Woodall2014},
and the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane \textit{or}
1-chloro-4-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene) is found in the
breast milk of Inuit mothers \autocite{Gibson2016} who live in polar regions,
very far from the tropical areas where it was once sprayed for pest control.

The chemical industry is also a prodigious producer of greenhouse gases. Apart
from the carbon dioxide emitted by the production of the energy that powers
chemical production processes, some chemical processes emit carbon dioxide as a
waste product. Most notable of these is the reduction of atmospheric nitrogen as
the first step in the production of nitrogen fertilizers. Of all the greenhouse
gases monitored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), only
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide are found in nature: the others are
exclusively products of the chemical industry \autocite{IPCC2014}.

No chemical has ever jumped out of a lab, multiplied uncontrollably, and spread
into the environment to poison or pollute: they have all been introduced into
the environment by human ignorance, negligence or recklessness. All chemicals
behave well when used in properly controlled environments, but human actions can
let them escape to damage and pollute. But while we try to solve the
intractable problem of human behaviour, we as chemists cannot just lay blame: we
must pay attention to the intrinsic safety of chemicals and chemical processes.

\subsection{``Green chemistry''}
\label{sec:GreenChemistry}
The date of birth of the environmental movement is conventionally set to 1962, when
the biologist Rachel Carson published the book \textit{Silent Spring}, which
pointed out the destruction of nature by the unrestricted use of pesticides and
the dangers of their overuse \autocite{Carson1962}. This was a direct imputation of
the chemical industry, because the pesticide products contained many chemicals.

Chemists are human, and the realization that uncontrolled chemicals can have
detrimental effects led at least some chemists to reflect on their own work.
This has given rise to the concept of \keyword{green chemistry}. Although the
term has no rigorous definition or quantitative measure
\autocite{Linthorst2010}, a set of 12 principles or guidelines are proposed
\autocite{Anastas1998}:

{\itshape
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed.
  
  \item Synthetic methods should be designed to
  maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final
  product.
  
  \item Wherever practicable, synthetic methodologies should
  be designed to use and generate substances that possess little or no toxicity
  to human health and the environment.
  
  \item Chemical products should be designed to preserve
  efficacy of function while reducing toxicity.
  
  \item \label{itm:aux}The use of auxiliary substances (\textit{e.g.} solvents,
  separation agents, etc.) should be made unnecessary wherever possible and
  innocuous when used.
  
  \item Energy requirements should be recognized for their
  environmental and economic impacts and should be minimized. Synthetic methods
  should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure.
  
  \item \label{itm:renewable}A raw material or feedstock should be renewable
  rather than depleting wherever technically and economically practicable.
  
  \item Unnecessary derivatization (blocking group,
  protection/deprotection, temporary modification of physical/chemical
  processes) should be avoided whenever possible.
  
  \item Catalytic reagents (as selective as possible) are
  superior to stoichiometric reagents.
  
  \item Chemical products should be designed so that at the end of their
  function they break down into innocuous degradation products and do not
  persist in the environment.
  
  \item Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to allow for
  real-time, in-process monitoring and control prior to the formation of
  hazardous substances.
  
  \item Substances and the form of a substance used in a chemical process should
  be chosen so as to minimize the potential for chemical accidents, including
  releases, explosions, and fires.

\end{enumerate}

} 

While these guidelines are clearly written with synthetic chemistry in mind, it
does not mean that they do not apply to analytical chemistry. For example,
Principle \ref{itm:renewable} suggests that, when possible, one should use
hydrogen rather than helium as mobile phase in capillary gas chromatography:
hydrogen is renewable, whereas helium is a finite resource and from time to time
there are reports of shortages \autocite{Kornblut2019}.

One large area of the greening of chemistry is changing the use of solvents.
Principle \ref{itm:aux} recommends that solvent use be avoided, as most solvents
used in chemistry are ultimately derived from petroleum and are toxic to some
degree. But solvents play a large role in many kinds of chemistry, and
eliminating their use in the near future seems unlikely. Searching for and
characterizing bio-derived, non-toxic, non-persistent solvents is an active
field of research \autocite{Clarke2018}. Fortunately there are a few solvents
already in use that are inherently ``green'', such as water or ethanol. One such
naturally green solvent is carbon dioxide.

\subsection{Carbon dioxide as a green chemical}

Carbon dioxide as a chemical is used in industry in a few key areas.

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item Carbon dioxide is often used in firefighting, in the form of portable
  fire extinguishers or room flooding systems. In this last use it is displacing
  the ozone-depleting halomethane `Halon' formulations.
  
  \item When liquid water is supersaturated with carbon dioxide, the gas
  desolvates slowly in the form of streams of tiny bubbles. This phenomenon
  makes beverages prepared from water supersaturated with carbon dioxide (or
  \keyword{carbonated water}) interesting to drink, and a large, international
  beverage industry is based on carbonated water.
   
   \item Carbon dioxide has a freezing point of \SI{-77}{\celsius}, and the
   solid can be conveniently obtained by evaporating liquid carbon dioxide at
   atmospheric pressure. The evaporating liquid rapidly cools the stream of
   carbon dioxide, lowering the temperature of the stream to below freezing
   point, and the gas crystallizes. The resulting `snow' can be compressed into
   blocks, which only slowly sublimates into gaseous carbon dioxide, keeping the
   temperature at the freezing point. Packing frozen food products together with
   this 'dry ice' allows for it to be transported cold without mechanical
   refrigeration.
   
   \item Pellets of dry ice can be entrained in a jet of air, and used to abrade
   surfaces for cleaning \autocite{Spur1999}. This use of carbon dioxide can
   displace toxic solvents or abate the noxious dust produced by blasting operations.
   
   \item Carbon dioxide is a `natural refrigerant' \autocite{Pearson2005} and
   can be used to displace hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants, which are potent,
   long-lived greenhouse gases.
   
   \item Carbon dioxide can be used as a preservative and anti-oxidant in
   packaged food. If air in a packaged food is removed by purging the headspace
   with carbon dioxide, the growth of microbes can be discouraged, extending the
   shelf life of the product \autocite{Jacobsen2002}.
	   
	\item Carbon dioxide can be used to extract compounds from natural products. 
	
\end{itemize}

Of these uses, extractions are economically the most important, where it
replaces hydrocarbon solvents.

\section{Extractions using carbon dioxide}

\subsection{Commercial extractions}

There are several commercial processes that use carbon dioxide to extract
valuable products from plant material.

\subsubsection{Plant oils}

Vegetable oils are obtained from various crops, and can be extracted from the
plant material by pressing, heating or extraction. High-pressure carbon dioxide
has been used to extract vegetable oils from various plants, although it seems
that this process has only found niche applications so far
\autocite{Eisenmenger2006,Grazyna2018}.

\subsubsection{Hops}

Hops is an essential component in the brewing of beer. It imparts a desired
bitter flavour, stabilizes the beer during storage, and assists with foam
formation \autocite{Schoenberger2011}. Hops is a seasonal crop with a limited
growing range, but the demand for beer is not limited to certain areas or
seasons. The creation of hops extract makes it possible for brewers to benefit from 
hops without owning a hops plantation or storing and transporting dried hops
over long distances. All hops extracts produced today are extracted by carbon
dioxide \autocite{Hunt2010}.

\subsubsection{Coffee}

Coffee is an international industry, with coffee drunk in many cultures and in
many forms. One of the attractions of coffee is the effects of the psychoactive
substance found in the coffee bean, \keyword{caffeine}. Caffeine is a mild
stimulant and promotes wakefulness. A small proportion of coffee drinkers enjoy
drinking coffee, but prefer to avoid the stimulant effect, which might induce
insomnia or irritability. For these coffee drinkers the market supplies
\keyword{decaffeinated coffee}.

Given the large amount of coffee traded (an estimated 167.47 million bags of
coffee in the 2018-2019 coffee year \autocite{Coffee2018})\footnote{The factoid
that ``coffee is the second-most traded commodity after oil'' has been proven to
be untrue \autocite{Greenberg2017}.}, if only a small percentage of coffee needs
to be decaffeinated, it will be a large amount of coffee to process, and
industrial processes will be necessary to supply the demand.

Decaffeination of coffee is achieved by selectively extracting the caffeine from
green (\textit{i.e.} unroasted) coffee beans using carbon dioxide. This is the
largest use of carbon dioxide for extraction \autocite{Ramalakshmi1999}. The
extracted caffeine is sold for use in medication and `energy' drinks.

\subsection{Analytical extractions}

Extraction is not only an industrial process: is an essential part of many
procedures used in analytical chemistry. Industrial extraction processes using
supercritical fluids were converted into analytical techniques
\autocite{Taylor2013}. Extractions using high-pressure gases for analytical
purposes is usually called \keyword{supercritical fluid extraction} (SFE).

\subsection{Why carbon dioxde?}

What makes carbon dioxide a suitable solvent for extraction?

There are two aspects to this question. The first is about the
\textit{greenness} of carbon dioxide. It is non-toxic, non-persistent,
non-flammable, non-corrosive, inexpensive, commercially available, and a waste
product. (It goes without saying that this carbon dioxide is sourced from a
carbon-neutral source, perhaps the brewing industry.) The second aspect of the
desirability of carbon dioxide lies in its physical properties and the
conditions under which it is used.

Chemists will intuitively understand that gaseous carbon dioxide has no solvating
properties, and that liquid carbon dioxide should not behave much differently
than any other solvent. Both these statements are true under `normal' circumstances.

But consider the case of an isobaric cooling of a volume of gas. The gas-liquid
transition takes place because energy is removed from the system: at some point
the kinetic energy of some of the molecules becomes less than the energy of the
intermolecular forces, and the molecules prefer to ``clump together'', \textit{i.e.}
it \keyword{condenses}. The remaining gas molecules receive the excess energy,
and therefore stay in the gas state, until more energy is removed, leading to
more of the gas condensing. During this process the temperature remains
constant, and the value of this temperature is known as the \keyword{boiling
point} of the compound.

Now consider a solid or liquid solute dispersed in the same volume of gas being
cooled. In this case, as the gas cools, the gas-solute intermolecular forces can
become stronger than than the gas-gas intermolecular forces at a temperature
which is higher than the boiling point. In such a case the gas molecules will
``clump'' around solute molecules, while the gas molecules will not ``clump
together''. Now the gas has obtained solvating properties and the solute is
truly dissolved in the gas, without any condensation of the gas itself. The same
effect can be imagined to happen during the isothermal compression of a gas.

If there is more than one solute in a volume of gas at a given temperature and
pressure, some might dissolve in the gas, while others might not. This means
that the solvating gas can be \keyword{selective}. It can also be seen that the
solvating power of the gas will depend on the temperature and the pressure of
the gas. This means that the solvent's solvating power becomes
\keyword{tunable}.

While the dense gas has solvating properties, it still has the physical
properties of a gas:

\begin{description} 

\item[Diffusivity] The solvating gas maintains its high diffusion coefficients,
which means that it can easily diffuse into porous material, and that solutes
will rapidly diffuse through it.

\item[Surface tension] The solvating gas has a low surface tension, which means
that it will readily `wet' surfaces and penetrate porous material.

\item[Viscosity] The solvating gas has a low viscosity, which means that it
takes little energy to pump it.

\end{description} 

For historical reasons such solvating gases are known as 'supercritical
fluids', because they were first obtained by heating a liquid at high pressure
\autocite{Berche2009}, so that the temperature and pressure of the substance is
higher than it's \keyword{critical point}. The critical pressure of a substance
is the pressure above which it is impossible to create a gas-liquid phase
transition by isobaric cooling, and the critical temperature is the temperature
above which it is impossible to create a gas-liquid phase transition by
isothermal compression. When the gas is at its critical temperature and critical
pressure, it is at its critical point. The critical point is very different from
the \keyword{triple point}: there is no equilibrium involved (See Figure
\ref{fig:co2phase}). The terms `supercritical fluid' and `dense gas' are
synonyms \autocite{Randall1982} --- the adjective `dense' in `dense gas' of
course implies that the gas behaviour is far from that of an ideal gas. There
are no discontinuities in binary diffusivity when temperature is changed from
above to below the critical temperature \autocite{Lauer1983}. Hence extractions
are often done under conditions which are not technically 'supercritical' but
still yields its benefits.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/CO2PhaseDiagram}
\decoRule
\caption[The carbon dioxide phase diagram]{The phase diagram of carbon dioxide \autocite{Wolfram|Alpha2019CO2Phase}.}
\label{fig:co2phase}
\end{figure}

The critical temperature of carbon dioxide is \SI{304.12}{\kelvin}
(\SI{31.10}{\celsius}) , and the critical pressure is \SI{7.39}{\mega\pascal}
(\SI{72.9}{\bar}). This temperature and pressure are easy to achieve in the
laboratory with standard chromatographic instrumentation, or in an industrial
plant with standard process engineering technologies.

Carbon dioxide is gaseous at ambient conditions. This means that once it has
been used in its role as extractant and is exposed to the atmosphere, it
will rapidly evaporate without added heat, leaving no residues.

Any pure compound will have a supercritical point. Compounds with
technologically feasible supercritical points and useful chemical properties
include ammonia, methanol, CFCs/Freon, hydrocarbons (propane, butane), water and
sulfur hexafluoride. All of these lack green attributes: hydrocarbons pollute,
the CFCs deplete ozone, sulfur hexafluoride is a potent greenhouse gas, and
methanol and water are liquid at ambient conditions. For these reasons the term
supercritical fluid extraction is practically synonymous with extraction using
high-pressure carbon dioxide\footnote{It is also possible to use supercritical
fluids as reactants. For example, treating vegetable oils with supercritical
methanol yields biodiesel in an uncatalized reaction.  This topics falls outside
the scope of this discussion.}.

 
\subsubsection{Modifiers}

\label{sec:modifiers}

The carbon dioxide molecule has zero dipole moment and the bulk fluid a low
dielectric constant, so supercritical carbon dioxide is expected to be
a non-polar solvent. (Although in practice the solvent behaviour is more
complex, partly explained by the high quadrupole moment of the carbon dioxide
molecule \autocite{Raveendran2005}.)

While the solvating power of a supercritical fluid is certainly `tuneable' by
adjusting its pressure and/or temperature, the range in solubility might be
quite limited in practice. Just as with other solvents, it is possible to add a
co-solvent or \keyword{modifier} to the supercritical carbon dioxide. This makes
it possible to increase the solubility of polar compounds in the supercritical
fluid. Methanol, ethanol, formic acid, and water are examples of suitable green
modifiers for carbon dioxide \autocite{Herrero2010}. When modifiers are used the
carbon dioxide, modifier and solute form a system with four degrees of freedom
(modifier fraction, solute fraction, pressure, and temperature), which
can become difficult to model. While this is a challenge for process engineers
who need to design efficient industrial systems, analytical chemists can afford
to be pragmatic and use heuristics to find suitable conditions
\autocite{Wells2003}.

\subsubsection{Practical extractions}

\label{fig:sfediagram}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:sfediagram} shows a schematic diagram of a system set up for
supercritical fluid extractions. Carbon dioxide (a) is readily available from
suppliers of industrial gases and high-purity grades are available.
Chromatography-grade solvents are usually used as modifiers (d). High-pressure
pumps (HPLC type) are used to compress the carbon dioxide (b) and the modifier
(c), which are mixed together at the appropriate ratio. The mixture gets pumped
into the (optionally heated (f)) extraction cell (e), which contains the
material that needs to be extracted. Having extracted the target compounds from
the material, the supercritical fluid passes through a pressure-control
mechanism (g). This allows the pressure of the supercritical fluid to drop to
ambient, turning it into a low-density non-solvating gas. The extract becomes
desolvated and precipitates in the collection vessel (h). The operation of the
system might be either static or dynamic: in static operation the supercritical
fluid is pumped into the system, the flow is stopped, the matrix/fluid
mixture is given time to approach equilibrium, and then the fluid is expelled and
the extract collected. In dynamic operation the supercritical fluid is pumped
through the extraction cell and the extract collected continuously.


\section{Supercritical fluid chromatography}

An analyte will extract out of a matrix into a given solvent with a certain
efficiency and at a certain rate. While this is important when finding an
optimum extraction method, its relevance is otherwise limited.

However, \textit{different} analytes will extract out of a matrix with
\textit{different} efficiencies and at \textit{different} rates. In a 1906 paper
the Russian botanist Mikhail Semyonovich Tsvet\footnote{Also transliterated from
Russian as Tsvett, Tswett, Tswet, Zwet, or Cvet} applied this observation to the
dynamic extraction with petrochemical solvents of a bed of calcium carbonate
that had mixture of plant pigments applied at the inlet end. The different
extraction efficiencies and rates of adsorption and desorption on the calcium
carbonate surface lead to the \keyword{separation} of the compounds in the
mixture. Tsvet called this method of separation \keyword{chromatography}
\autocite{Ettre1993,Ettre1993a}. (See Figure \ref{fig:ChromatographyBasics}.)
With time this method became generalized, and today chromatography is a major,
established scientific field with many ramifications and a myriad of
applications.

\begin{figure}[hptb] \centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Chromatography_Basics} \decoRule
\caption[Basic Chromatography]{A conceptual diagram of basic chromatography. (a)
A mixture of compounds (represented by squares and triangles) are introduced in
a thin band on the head of a column (stippled area). (b) A solvent (grey) is run
through the column. The different compounds migrate at different rates. (c) If
conditions are optimal the compounds are separated fully (but not excessively)
when they reach the end of the column. \(R_s = 2 (l_1 - l_2)/(w_1 + w2)}
\label{fig:ChromatographyBasics}


\end{figure}

The effectiveness of a chromatographic system is judged by how well it separates
two compounds of interest. The separation is quantified by the
\keyword{resolution} (\(R_s\)), which is calculated as the ratio of the distance
by which the two compounds of interest have been separated to the width to which
they have spread during the separation. Because it rarely possible to directly
measure a distance in modern instruments, \keyword{retention time} (\(t_r\)) is
normally used as a proxy for the distance travelled. To compare the retention of
different compounds in different columns, a normalized measure is used to remove
the effect of their \keyword{hold-up time} (\(t_m\) )in the column. This is the
\keyword{retention factor}, \(k = \frac{t_r-t_m}{t_m}\), and is related to the
relative amounts of the analyte in the mobile and stationary phases. The
relative retention of two compounds can then quantified by the
\keyword{separation factor} \(\alpha = \frac{k_2}{k_1} \). The values of \(k\)
and \(\alpha\) are primarily determined by thermodynamic and chemical factors,
respectively, but these only quantify the retention of the two compounds used to
calculate separation, and not how much they spread as they migrate through the
column. The spread of the components during separation is described by a
quantity known as the \keyword{plate number} (\(N\)), which depends on the
physical form of the column and stationary phase, the diffusion coefficients of
the mobile phase, and the flow rate of the mobile phase. The values of \(N\),
\(k\), and \(\alpha\) are practically independent and can be used to calculate
the resolution:
 
\[ {R_s} = \frac{\sqrt{N}}{4}\left(\frac{k}{k+1}\right)\left(\frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha}\right) \]

(Rigorous derivations of this equation can be found in the literature
\autocite{Sandra1989a} and precise definitions of the factors are
provided by IUPAC \autocite{Ettre1993b}.)

The number of plates \(N\) depends on the length \(L\) of the column: the longer
the column, the more the band of an analyte will spread during separation. To
compare columns of different lengths, the \keyword{plate height} \(H\) is used,
where \(H\) = \(L / N \). A first-order approximation of plate height is
provided by the \keyword{Van Deemter equation},

\[ H = A + B/u + C u \] 

where \(u\) is the linear velocity of the mobile phase. The coefficient \(A\)
describes band broadening by the mere flow through the column, \(B\) describes
the broadening due to longitudinal diffusion in the mobile phase, and \(C\)
describes the broadening due to resistance to mass transfer between the mobile
and stationary phases. A rigorous derivation of this equation can be found in
the literature  \autocite{Sandra1989}.

An automated instrument that performs chromatography is called a
\keyword{chromatograph}. Such an instrument maintains the composition and state
of the mobile phase (which controls \(k\)), allows the installation of columns
with different stationary phases (which controls \(\alpha\) and \(N\)) and
regulates the flow of the mobile phase (which controls \(H\)). It also has a
\keyword{detector}, a device that monitors the composition of the
\keyword{eluate}. A change in the eluate composition results in a change in the
signal from the detector, and is usually caused by an analyte eluting. As the
band of analyte elute the signal from the detector first increases, reaches a
maximum, and then decreases, which causes a \keyword{peak} in a graph of the
signal \textit{vs} time. This graph is called a \keyword{chromatogram}.
Contemporary chromatographs are controlled by electronic digital computers and
usually produce chromatograms as computer files which are viewed and processed
by specialized software.

Because of the different technologies used in its applications, chromatography
is conventionally classed by the state of its mobile phase as either
\keyword{gas chromatography} (GC) or \keyword{liquid chromatography} (LC).
However, as we have seen, solvating gases can also extract analytes from solid
stationary phases, and hence the term \keyword{supercritical fluid
chromatography} (SFC) was created for these kinds of separations.

Supercritical fluid chromatography as practised today bears a great resemblance
to \keyword{high performance liquid chromatography} (HPLC) (See Figure
\ref{fig:sfcdiagram}). The main reason for this is that there is a large overlap
between the technology used for HPLC and the technology needed for SFC. In
particular, both use high-pressure pumps and columns packed with particles of
very small diameter and use optical detectors. Manufacturers supplying HPLC
instrumentation often also supply SFC instrumentation.

\begin{figure}[hptb]

\label{fig:sfcdiagram}

\end{figure}

A full discussion of the differences between SFC and HPLC is beyond the scope of
this thesis, but the kinetic advantages of SFC are considerable. In a study
comparing SFC and LC methods for the analytical separation of pharmaceutical
compounds \autocite{Perrenoud2012}, the flow at minimum plate height \(H\), was
found to be five times higher for SFC than for LC when using columns packed with
\SI{3.5}{\micro\metre} particles, and four times higher for columns packed with
\SI{1.7}{\micro\metre} particles. (See Figure \ref{fig:SFCvsHPLC_Van_Deemter}).
This difference in in speed is attributed to the higher diffusivity of
supercritical carbon dioxide, which increases the rate of mass transfer between
the stationary and mobile phases.

\begin{figure}[hptb] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/SFCvsHPLC_Van_Deemter} \decoRule
\caption[Van Deemter]{Kinetic performance as a function of linear velocity for

injected. Adapted from \autocite{Perrenoud2012}.}
\label{fig:SFCvsHPLC_Van_Deemter}

\end{figure}

These high speeds can be achieved at much lower pressure drops per length of
column than in LC, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:SFCvsHPLC_Pressure}. This can be
attributed to the low viscosity of supercritical carbon dioxide, because, for a
given flow rate, less energy is required to pump the lower-viscosity
supercritical fluid than the higher-viscosity liquid.

\begin{figure}[hptb] \centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/SFCvsHPLC_Pressure} \decoRule

velocity of the corresponding curve in Figure \ref{fig:SFCvsHPLC_Van_Deemter},
normalized to \SI{1}{\metre} of column to avoid influence of column geometry
variations. Adapted from \autocite{Perrenoud2012}.}
\label{fig:SFCvsHPLC_Pressure}

\end{figure}

This low pressure drop can be exploited by using very long columns to generate a
large number of plates.

\subsection{SFC and FID}
\label{sec:FID}

But SFC was not always a technique based on HPLC technology. In the 1980s SFC
was practised using open tubular columns and flame detectors, so the instrument
designs looked more like GC instruments than HPLC instruments, and SFC was
promoted as a replacement for GC \autocite{Poole2003}. During this era the
detectors used for SFC were the flame-based detectors developed for GC, in
particular the flame ionization detector (FID). The \keyword{flame ionization
detector} was invented near-simultaneously in South Africa and New Zealand
\autocite{Ettre2008}. The core of the system is a flame of hydrogen gas burning
in pure air (See Figure \ref{fig:fiddiagram}). The measured signal is the
electrical conductivity of the flame plasma, which is measured by applying a
\SI{-100}{\volt} potential difference between electrodes at the tip and the base
of the flame. There are very few free ions in the hydrogen flame, so the
conductivity is normally low. But if organic compounds are introduced into the
flame free ions are created during their combustion, which increases the
conductivity of the flame gases. The change in conductivity is measured by
measuring the small current between the two electrodes with an
\keyword{electrometer}.

As a first approximation the signal produced by the FID is proportional to the
number of carbon atoms in the analyte. The mechanism that explains this
surprising result is fairly simple: at high temperature in the hydrogen-rich
core of the flame, all the carbon atoms in the analyte are reduced to methane
\autocite{Holm1996}. Once it gets into contact with the hot oxygen in the outer
layers of the flame there is a chemi-ionization reaction. The electric field
acting on the ions creates a flow of ions, which can be measured as an electric
current. The current is proportional to the number of ions, which is
proportional to the number of methane molecules, which is proportional to the
number of carbon atoms in the analyte.

The FID's shining strength as a detector is its tremendous linear dynamic range
of 10\textsuperscript{7}. Combining the linear dynamic range with its carbon
sensitivity makes it an excellent detector for quantifying organic compounds.
During the period of history when SFC was seen as a variant of GC, the FID was
the detector of choice. But when SFC started resembling HPLC, and the
selectivity of the chromatography started being manipulated by adding modifiers
(see Section \ref{sec:modifiers}), the FID lost its utility. The quantity of
modifier added to the carbon dioxide mobile phase swamps the FID,
rendering it useless as a detector. In contrast, if the chosen modifiers are
transparent at the relevant wavelengths, optical detectors are more useful in
SFC using modified carbon dioxide as a mobile phase.

\subsection{SFC×GC}
\label{sec:SFCxGC}
In chromatography, the analyte in the eluate can be detected to yield
information about the sample, or fractions of eluate can be collected for
further purification or characterization, or both. If fractions are collected,
there is nothing that prevents the chromatographer from subjecting a collected
fraction to another chromatographic separation. For example, a synthetic chemist
might use column chromatography to separate their target compound from
side-reaction compounds, collecting fractions of the eluate. If the compounds
are colourless, the chemist might use \keyword{thin-layer chromatography} (TLC)
to examine the fractions for presence and purity of the relevant compounds. If
the product and the side-product were co-eluting it would not help to use the
same chromatographic system (\textit{i.e.} combination of stationary phase and
mobile phase) for the TLC examination, because the co-elution would not become
apparent. If, however, the chemist changed the mobile phase, or switched to a
different stationary phase for the TLC examination, it is quite likely that the
two compounds would be separated. For example, if a synthesis involving sugars
were being attempted, two sugar enantiomers would likely co-elute on a silica
clean-up column. Investigating the sugar fraction using a TLC plate with a
chiral stationary phase would reveal the presence of stereoisomers. The second
(chiral) separation (on TLC) is said to be \keyword{orthogonal} to the first
(packed column) separation. Such a separation is an example of a two-dimensional
(2D) separation. In analytical chromatography, 2D separations is a powerful
tool. The simplest 2D chromatography is called \keyword{heart-cutting}. In such
a case a fraction of interest is collected from the \keyword{first dimension}
(\oneD) separation, and subjected to a \keyword{second dimension} (\twoD)
separation. For example, a fraction collected from an HPLC separation could be
injected into a gas chromatograph. The separation on the GC dimension would
obviously be very different from the separation on the HPLC dimension, and
therefore we can say that the orthogonality is high.

Heart-cutting is a useful way to get detailed information from a sample, but it
is technically demanding and labour-intensive. It is usually employed for
challenging separations in well-understood samples, because peaks of interest in
the first dimension must be captured for injection on the second dimension. This
requires precise timing under supervision of an expert chromatographer.

If, however, one collects the eluate in equal fractions and does identical
separations of each of the fractions, then one enters the domain of
\keyword{comprehensively coupled chromatography}. The comprehensive coupling of
orthogonal chromatographies does not demand a previous understanding of the
sample, and doing exactly the same separation for each fraction allows the
process to be automated.

A 2D separation can be called comprehensive if the following three criteria are
met \autocite{Giddings1987}:

\begin{enumerate}
  
  \item Every part of the sample is separated by two distinct chromatographic
  processes.
  
  \item Equal percentages of all sample fractions are separated by the second
  process. (Ideally \SI{100}{\percent} of each fraction would be subjected to
  the second process, but sometimes it might be necessary to reduce the
  transferred percentage, for example to prevent column overloading.)
  
  \item Compounds resolved by the first dimension separation remain resolved.

\end{enumerate} 

To effectively distinguish between heart-cut and comprehensive 2D couplings, a
terse nomenclature was developed {Marriott2012}. Simple coupling between systems
is designated by a hyphen (``-''), for example ``HPLC-GC''. This corresponds to
the usual notation of a coupled detector coupled to a chromatograph, for example
GC-FID or GC-MS. Comprehensive coupling is denoted by a multiplex sign (``×''),
for example GC×GC. If it is not clear from the context, the detector can be
specified using a hyphen, as in GC×GC-MS. Of the comprehensive coupled
chromatography techniques, GC×GC is the most mature, with a selection of
powerful instruments on the market.

This thesis further explores the implementation of SFC×GC, first demonstrated by
Venter and Rohwer \autocite{Venter2004, Venter2006}. In the implementation of
SFC×GC described in this thesis, fractions of the eluate from the SFC are
transferred to the GC. The mobile phase is changed from carbon dioxide to
hydrogen in the modulating interface, and the GC dimension is a conventional
open-tubular capillary separation with FID detection. Any volatile modifiers or
additives added to the SFC mobile phase will be separated from the analytes by
the GC dimension. This makes it possible to still use the FID as a detector in
an SFC×GC chromatograph where the SFC is based on HPLC technology.

The \twoD separations are \keyword{fast} chromatographic separations,
\textit{i.e.} separations optimized for speed, sacrificing resolution. This is
achieved using fast temperature programming of the GC separation. The high
orthogonality of the SFC and the GC separations enables novel comprehensive 2D
chromatography, which was applied to the chemical analysis of biodiesel.
