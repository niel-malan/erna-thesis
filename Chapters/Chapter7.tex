\section{Introduction}

In South Africa the quality of biodiesel is regulated by the technical standard
\std{SANS 1935}, and that of petrodiesel by \std{SANS 342}. There is a
considerable overlap in the requirements of the two, as discussed in Section
\ref{sec:Comparison} and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Venn}. Two of the
requirements of \std{SANS 342} that do not overlap with \std{SANS 1935} are the
allowed amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fatty acid methyl
esters (FAMEs). This chapter's discussion introduces the application of a single
SFC×GC method to do both these determinations.

\subsection{FAMEs in diesel}

Biodiesel can be blended in all proportions with diesel obtained from petroleum
(\keyword{petrodiesel}). To reduce the carbon footprint of diesel fuel,
legislators are encouraging the use of blended fuels. In South Africa the
standard grade of diesel may contain up to \SI{5}{\percent} volume fraction
biodiesel, and higher fractions of FAMEs are allowed as different grades.
Manufacturers might also add biodiesel to their fuel formulations to improve
properties such as lubricity \autocite{Knothe2005}, or for its ability to reduce
engine emissions \autocite{Wattrus2016}.

The test methods for FAMEs in standard diesel allowed by \std{SANS 342} are
\std{EN 14078}, \std{ASTM D7806}, or \std{ASTM D7371}. These are all infrared
(IR) absorption methods. The methods described in \std{EN 14078} and \std{ASTM
D7806} measure the absorption of infrared radiation at
\SI{1745}{\per\centi\metre} (\SI{5.4}{\micro\metre}) in an absorption cell with
a path length of \SI{0.5}{\milli\metre}. The stretching vibrations of the
carbonyl groups found in the ester functional group of FAMEs resonate with
electromagnetic radiation at this wavelength, which causes strong absorption.
The hydrocarbons that constitute the bulk of petrodiesel do not absorb radiation
of this wavelength and will not interfere with the measurement. A Beer's law
method is used for calibration and quantitation. The method prescribed by
\std{ASTM D7371} specifies \keyword{attenuated total reflection} (ATR) IR
absorption spectrophotometry combined with \keyword{partial least squares} (PLS)
calibration, which simplifies sample handling but complicates calibration. Both
these methods make some assumptions about the sample, and the methods may suffer
from inaccuracy if those assumptions do not hold \autocite{Pinho2014}.

\subsection{PAHs in diesel} 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are noxious pollutants and are therefore
regulated when possible. The primary source of PAHs that enter the environment is
combustion, of which a portion takes place in internal-combustion engines. PAHs
are also abundant in fossil fuels, including diesel, and might escape from
diesel during normal operations or in accidents. Primarily, however, the higher
the proportion of aromatic compounds in diesel fuel, the higher the PAH
emissions of the engine it fuels. These higher emissions are ascribed to the
poorer combustion of fuels containing higher amounts of aromatics. By limiting
the amount of PAHs in diesel regulators aim to reduce the exposure of the
population to the harm of PAHs.

\std{SANS 342} describes two classes of diesel fuel, CF1 and CF2, named after the
Department of Energy's Cleaner Fuels programme. For CF1 the standard does not
include a requirement for PAHs, but for CF2 an upper limit of \SI{8}{\percent}
mass fraction is prescribed. At the time of writing the implementation date of
the CF2 standard had been indefinitely postponed. 

The test methods for determining the amount of PAHs in diesel prescribed by
\std{SANS 342} are \std{IP 391}, \std{ASTM D2425}, or \std{EN 12916}. In case of
dispute \std{EN 12916} is the referee method. \std{IP 391} and  \std{EN 12916}
are HPLC methods with \keyword{refractive index} detection. \std{ASTM D2425},
although entitled ``Standard Test Method for Hydrocarbon Types in Middle
Distillates by Mass Spectrometry'' requires the chromatographic separation of
the aromatics from the saturates by chromatography before the MS measurement.
All these methods allow for the presence of FAMEs in diesel.
Although these methods undoubtedly provide reliable results when applied
intelligently, quantitation by refractive index and mass spectrometric detection
have their problems, as reviewed in detail by \cite{Kaminski2005}.
As an example of one of the challenges for RI detection, there is no correlation
between the refractive index of a compound and its chemical structure. Therefore
successful quantitation depends on the precise determination of response
factors. But in a mixture of petrochemicals from different feedstocks the
compounds and their relative quantities are unknown, so the physical meaning of
the determined peak areas is unclear.

Although not specified by \std{SANS 342}, \std{ASTM D5186} \autocite{ASTMD5186}
is an SFC-FID method for determining the amount and type of aromatic compounds.
In principle it is similar to the prescribed HPLC methods, with three key
differences: it uses neat carbon dioxide at high pressure as a mobile phase, it
uses bare silica as a stationary phase, and it uses flame ionization as a
detector (FID). As discussed in Section \ref{sec:FID}, the FID has an
unsurpassed dynamic range and responds to the primarily to the number of carbon
atoms in the analyte, which means that its signal reflects the mass of the
analyte. This makes it a reliable and robust detector that excels at
quantitation.

\subsection{SFC×GC of petrodiesel/biodiesel blends}

The elution properties of aromatic hydrocarbons on SFC are different from those
of FAMEs. Being polar oxygenates, the FAMEs are much more retained on silica
than the non-polar aromatic compounds, and the two classes elute separately.
But, just as the aromatic hydrocarbon compounds elute in order of their number
of rings, the FAMEs elute in order of their number of double bonds
\autocite{Smith2001}.

Comprehensively coupling GC to separate fractions of the SFC eluate on a second
dimension will then yield further information that correlates with the molecular
mass of the compounds. The simplicity of coupling GC to SFC has been recognized
and used for the detailed analysis of hydrocarbon groups in diesel
\autocite{Pal1998}. 


\section{Experimental}

\subsection{Samples} 

\subsubsection{Diesel/biodiesel blend}
A sample was prepared by blending \SI{7}{\percent} of biodiesel from canola
(labelled "rapeseed methyl ester" (RME)) with a commercial low-sulfur (50 ppm)
diesel. (The \SI{7}{\percent} blend was chosen to reflect the amount allowed by
\std{EN 590}, the European equivalent to \std{EN 342}). In a GC×GC-MS analysis
using \keyword{electron-impact} (EI) ionization the relative percentages of
total ion intensity for different classes of compounds were \SI{68.19}{\percent}
alkanes, \SI{18.10}{\percent} alkenes, \SI{13.69}{\percent} aromatics and
\SI{0.01}{\percent} oxygenates \autocite{Smit2015}.

\subsubsection{Spiked diesel}
The relative retention times of aromatic compounds with different numbers of
rings will differ. To study this effect, known amounts of a selection of
aromatic compounds were added (\keyword{spiked}) to a neat sample of the
low-sulfur diesel. The retention times of these compounds will give an
indication of how the structure of an aromatic compound influences its retention
time, which will guide the 2D chromatographic pattern interpretation. To keep
costs low the compounds were selected from standards available in the
laboratory, rather than compounds that might be used in standard methods. They
were also selected to have high boiling points, because the temperature control
at the start of the fast GC run is not as reliable as it could be, sometimes
causing poor peak shapes. Under other circumstances toluene and tetralin
(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) might have been chosen as the monocyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon spikes, because these are prescribed for use in a
performance mixture by \std{ASTM D5186} and would be more familiar to users of
that method. Although chemists might assume that PAHs all have fused rings,
\std{ASTM D5186} terminology makes it clear that the rings need not be fused:
therefore bibenzyl and naphthalene are both examples of dicyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons.
The selected compounds and their amounts used in the spike are listed in Table
\ref{tab:Aromatics}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{SFC}

The injection system described in Section \ref{sec:SFCInjection} was used to
inject a \SI{0.5}{\micro\litre} volume of the samples. The SFC mobile phase was
neat carbon dioxide at \SI{200}{\bar} inlet pressure. The column consisted of
five HPLC bare silica columns (\SI{150}{\milli\metre} $\times$
\SI{4.6}{\milli\metre}, 3 $\mu$m particles) (Restek, Pinnacle DB Silica)
connected in series.

\subsection{Modulation}

Two modulation periods were used: For the first portion of the chromatogram SFC
eluate fractions of \SI{3}{\second} were collected on the GC column cooled to a
temperature of \SI{-20}{\celsius} or below. The inlet vent was held closed for
\SI{3}{\second} after the the SFC stop valve closed to allow the last of the
eluted fraction to be swept onto the column, and then opened for \SI{1}{\second}
to release excess pressure. For the second portion of the chromatogram the same
trapping temperature was used, but the modulation period was increased to
\SI{10}{\second}. This longer trapping period causes a higher increase in inlet
pressure by the eluting carbon dioxide, which required a vent time of
\SI{3}{\second} to release the excess pressure.

\subsection{GC}

The column used in the fast gas chromatograph was an DB-5MS column from J\&W
Scientific Inc, which has a stationary phase comprised of \SI{5}{\percent}
diphenyl, \SI{95}{\percent} di\-meth\-yl\-poly\-si\-lox\-ane. It was \SI{1}{\metre} long,
with an internal diameter of \SI{0.25}{\milli\metre}. The thickness of the
stationary phase was \SI{0.25}{\micro\metre}, and had an operational temperature
range of \SI{-60}{\celsius} to \SI{325}{\celsius} for isothermal elution, or up
to \SI{350}{\celsius} when using temperature programming.

For every fast GC run the temperature program ramped from \SI{-30}{\celsius} at a
rate of \SI{8000}{\celsius\per\minute} to \SI{25}{\celsius}, and from there to
\SI{350}{\celsius} at a rate of \SI{2000}{\celsius\per\minute}, where it was
held for \SI{2}{s}. After the temperature program had ended the column was
cooled to \SI{-20}{\celsius} again and the next fraction was collected. Figure
\ref{fig:Setpoint_Following} compares the indicated average temperature of the
column with the temperature program.

shows the actual indicated temperature, as recorded. The ``steps'' in the orange
line are caused by the \SI{100}{\milli\second} period of the control loop.}

	\label{fig:Setpoint_Following} 
\end{figure}

Fast GC chromatograms were obtained by recording the signal of the FID, kept at
a temperature of \SI{350}{\celsius}. The amplifier gain was set so that an FID
current of \SI{1e-8}{\ampere} gave a \SI{10}{\volt} output signal. The collected
GC chromatograms were used to compile the 2D chromatogram.

\section{Results and discussion}

\caption[Biodiesel separated from petrodiesel.]{A 2D chromatogram of the

both. The chromatogram was compiled from \num{368} 1D fast temperature-programmed GC
chromatogram}

	\label{fig:PAH_FAMEs} 
\end{figure}




The chromatogram of the biodiesel/petrodiesel blend (Figure \ref{fig:PAH_FAMEs})
shows that the blend was separated into two distinct groups of compounds. At a
\oneD (SFC) retention time of about \SI{980}{\second} the hydrocarbons from the
petrodiesel part of the blend elute. To those familiar with petrochemical
chromatography the characteristic unresolved complex mixture (``hydrocarbon
hump'') topped by alkane peaks will be instantly recognizable as representing a
petroleum product. (See Figure \ref{fig:HCHump} for an example.)

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/hchump.pdf}

\caption[An example of a petrochemical fuel chromatogram.]{An example of a GC
chromatogram obtained from a petroleum-based diesel fuel sample, showing the
unresolved complex mixture topped by alkane peaks.}
	
	\label{fig:HCHump} 
\end{figure}

At \(^{1}t_{r} \geq \) \SI{2200}{\second} a series of tall peaks represent the
FAMEs, in a pattern that was described in Chapter \ref{Chapter6}: \oneD
separation is according to the number of double bonds of the fatty acids, and
\twoD separation is according to the chain length of the fatty acids.


\subsection{Aromatic hydrocarbons}

Between \SI{980}{\second} and \SI{1200}{\second} a pattern of small peaks elute.
This portion of the chromatogram is shown magnified in Figure
\ref{fig:Hydrocarbons_Portion}, where individual peaks can clearly be distinguished.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Hydrocarbons_Portion.png}
	\decoRule	
	
\caption[Hydrocarbons in RME/CD6 blend.]{Hydrocarbons in RME/CD6 blend}
	
	\label{fig:Hydrocarbons_Portion} 
\end{figure}

This result can be compared to the results of the SFC-FID method by integrating
each \twoD GC chromatogram, and plotting these values against their start times.
This creates a virtual SFC chromatogram, which should look similar to 1D SFC
chromatograms. The virtual SFC chromatogram corresponding to Figure
\ref{fig:Hydrocarbons_Portion} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:Virtual_SFC},
compared to an SFC-GC chromatogram taken from the paper on which \std{ASTM 5186}
is based \autocite{DiSanzo1991}. The similarity between the virtual and real
chromatograms confirms that the pattern of peaks that elute shortly after the
alkanes are the aromatic hydrocarbons. The virtual chromatogram seems to show
that there is incomplete separation between the alkanes and the aromatics, but
the 2D chromatogram shows that there is complete separation between any aromatic
compound and its nearest neighbour alkane, but that there is tailing from the
SFC column, which can be ascribed to excessive dead volume in the post-column
flow path.

\end{figure}


Although the identification of peaks of aromatic hydrocarbons in the SFC×GC
chromatogram is beyond the scope of this project, injection of the spiked diesel
sample shown in Figure \ref{fig:Spiked_Diesel} confirms that aromatic compounds
elute in this region and shows that the PAHs in diesel can be clearly separated
from the alkanes and quantified. By comparing the boiling points and relative
masses of the spike compounds, a tentative peak assignment could be made, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:Spiked_Diesel_Annotated}.

assignments were made using knowledge of the boiling points and relative masses

	\label{fig:Spiked_Diesel_Annotated} 
\end{figure}

It should be noted that the 5-ring PAH compound benzo[\textit{a}]pyrene that was
included in the spike did not elute on this chromatogram. Its retention time is
still unknown, but broad interfering peaks in subsequent chromatograms can be
attributed to slowly-eluting benzo[\textit{a}]pyrene.

Previous work has shown that SFC can also separate the alkenes from the alkanes
\autocite{Venter1999}, at least in petrol, and that the resolution can be
improved by cooling the SFC column. Further research along these lines might
reveal that is possible to separate the alkenes from the alkanes in diesel.
While cooling requires more hardware, the SFC×GC instrument discussed in this
thesis offers two sources of cooling that might be exploited in such a project:
a portion of the coolant used to cool the SFC pump (see Section
\ref{sec:CO2Pump}) can be diverted to cool the column, or any excess coolant
from the cooling cycle of the fast GC can be used to also cool the SFC column.
Alternatively, small solid-state Peltier cooling devices used for cooling
integrated circuits are readily available on the consumer market.

\subsection{FAMEs}

Between the \textsuperscript{1}D retention times of \SI{2200}{\second} and
\SI{3200}{\second} the peaks of the FAMEs are seen, clearly separated by number
of double bonds in the SFC dimension, and by volatility in the GC dimension.
When compared to an SFC×GC chromatogram of FAMEs obtained from canola oil (see
Figure \ref{fig:2DCanola}), the pattern is clearly similar, so the label
``rapeseed methyl ester'' is not incorrect.

\subsection{Adjustable modulation}

Because the SFC is operated in stopped flow mode, the modulation period is
independent of the fast GC run times. This means that the modulation period can
be adapted during the SFC×GC chromatographic run. Short modulation periods might
be required to preserve resolution obtained in the \oneD separation but this
will increase the total SFC×GC run time. In areas of the chromatogram where
there is plenty of resolution the modulation period might be increased to
decrease the run time.

In the chromatogram of the biodiesel blend (Figure \ref{fig:PAH_FAMEs}), the
modulation period was \SI{3}{\second} up to a \oneD retention time of
\SI{1100}{s}. After that the modulation period was increased to
\SI{10}{\second}, which shortened the chromatographic run time. In this
instrument this is the upper limit of the modulation period, and is determined
by the flow of carbon dioxide that the FID flame can tolerate. If the flow of
carbon dioxide through the column during trapping becomes too high, the flame is
extinguished and the signal disappears. This limitation can fairly simply be
overcome by arranging automatic re-ignition of the flame before the start of the
fast GC run. Then the upper limit of the modulation period depends on the
pressure limits of the GC inlet. These might be mechanical, but experience has
also taught that overly high inlet pressures can damage pressure gauges without
any other sign of over-pressure.

\subsubsection{Trapping suspension}

In an extreme version of adjustable modulation, it is also possible  suspend
trapping. This is implemented by opening both the SFC stop valve and the GC
inlet vent. The SFC eluate is then swept out of the GC inlet with no, or
minimal, trapping on the GC column. This scheme might be used, for example,
between \(^{1}t_r = 1200\) and \(^{1}t_r = 2200\) of the diesel blend
chromatogram. No peaks of interest elute during this period, so suspending
trapping can save a significant amount of time.

\subsubsection{Variable temperature programs}

Because stopped-flow operation decouples the SFC and the GC, the modulation
period is independent of the GC run time as discussed in the previous sections.
But this also implies that, conversely,  the GC run time is independent of the
modulation period. This means that the GC fast temperature program can be
adapted to suit the GC separation of the different classes of compounds as
separated by the SFC. For example, in the chromatogram shown in Figure
\ref{fig:PAH_FAMEs} it can be seen that the FAMEs elute in a narrower
temperature range than the hydrocarbons, which suggests that a different
temperature program can be used for optimum separation.

\subsection{Application}

The separation of the compounds found in the \SI{7}{\percent} diesel/biodiesel
blend shows that SFC×GC can be used to investigate the amount FAMEs and PAHs
petrodiesel/biodiesel blends without sample pre-treatment or specialized
columns. The intrinsic orthogonality provides easy identification of components
and the excess separation space allows for the addition of suitable internal
standards for reliable qualitative and quantitative analysis, while exploiting
the robustness and reliability of the FID. Expensive mass spectrometric
detection is unnecessary.

Being able to determine the biodiesel content of biodiesel blends may prove
useful in at least two scenarios: 

The first is in monitoring blending. Biodiesel (essentially a mixture of esters)
is quite polar compared to petrodiesel (essentially a mixture of hydrocarbons).
This means that blending might not be a matter of just pumping the relevant
volumes of the respective fuels into a tank and relying on diffusion to complete
the mixing. Being able to determine the amount of biodiesel in different samples
of a blend will provide assurance that the blend is homogenous and should
perform according to expectations. While such monitoring is perhaps better
performed using a spectroscopic method, SFC×GC can provide information for
calibration, and will of course be invaluable during trouble shooting.

The second application of SFC×GC is in regulating biodiesel content. In some
political environments fuels might be taxed according to their
biologically-derived content, for example to promote agriculture or to meet
carbon emissions targets. Sometimes biological content is simply mandated. Such
incentives and mandates are of course liable to corruption, and therefore it is
necessary to be able to monitor the blending of the fuels. The most
reliable way to differentiate between organic matter derived from biological
sources and organic matter derived from fossil sources is a radiochemical
method, where the content of radioactive \textsuperscript{14}C is determined.
(Organic material from fossil sources contains no \textsuperscript{14}C.) The
technical standard \std{ASTM D6866} provides an approved method. But radiochemical
methods require specialized equipment and trained staff, whereas fuel
laboratories more often have experience with chromatographic techniques and
might find SFC×GC a useful technique to provide evidence that a diesel fuel
blend contains the stated amount of biodiesel.

\section{Conclusion}

In the transition to a low-carbon economy that protects and promotes human
dignity and health, the standards set for fuels for internal combustion engines
will continue to evolve. This evolution will pose increasingly challenging
problems to the analytical chemist. While innovation will undoubtedly produce
new analytical instrumentation, the application of SFC×GC to the analysis of
diesel/biodiesel blends shows that is possible to create new, sophisticated
methods of analysis by re-imagining mature, trusted, and reliable analytical
chemistry technologies.
