\section{Introduction}

In South Africa the quality of biodiesel is regulated by the technical standard
SANS 1935, and petrodiesel by SANS 342. There is a considerable overlap in the
requirements of the two, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:Comparison},
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Venn}. Two of the requirements of SANS 342 that
does not overlap with SANS 1935 are the allowed amounts of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). This chapter's
discussion introduces the application of SFC×GC to these determinations. 

\subsection{FAMEs in diesel}

Biodiesel can be blended in all proportions with diesel obtained from petroleum
(\keyword{petrodiesel}). To reduce the carbon footprint of diesel fuel,
legislators are encouraging the use of blended fuels. In South Africa standard
grades of diesel may contain up to \SI{5}{\percent} volume fraction biodiesel, 
and higher fractions of FAMEs are allowed as different grades. Manufacturers might
also add biodiesel to their fuel formulations to present improve properties such as
lubricity \autocite{Knothe2005}, or to reduce emissions \autocite{Wattrus2016}.

The prescribed test methods for FAMEs in standard diesel are EN 14078, ASTM
D7806 and ASTM D7371. These are all infrared absorption methods. The first two
method measures the absorption of infrared radiation at
\SI{1745}{\per\centi\metre} (\SI{5.4}{\micro\metre}) in a cell with a path
length of \SI{0.5}{\milli\metre}. The method prescribed by ASTM D7371
specifies attenuated total reflection (ATR) sampling, which simplifies sample
handling but complicates calibration. Both these methods makes some assumptions
about the sample, and the methods may suffer from inaccuracy if those assumptions
do not hold \autocite{Pinho2014}.

\subsection{PAHs in diesel} 

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are noxious pollutants and are therefore
regulated when possible. The primary source of PAHs in the environment is
combustion, of which a portion is in internal-combustion engines.  PAHs might
escape from diesel fuel during normal operations or in accidents. Additionally,
the higher the proportion of aromatic compounds in diesel fuel, the higher the
PAH emissions of the engine that uses it. These higher emissions are ascribed to
the poorer combustion of fuels containing aromatics. Therefore, the amount of
PAHs in diesel is regulated.

SANS 342 describes two classes of diesel fuel, CF1 and CF2, named after the
Department of Energy's Cleaner Fuels program. For CF1 the standard does not
include a requirement for PAHs, but for CF2 an upper limit of \SI{8}{\percent}
mass fraction is prescribed.

The prescribed test methods are IP 391, ASTM D2425, EN 12916. In case of dispute
EN 12916 is the referee method. IP 391 and  EN 12916 are HPLC methods with
\keyword{refractive index} detection. ASTM D2425, although entitled ``Standard
Test Method for Hydrocarbon Types in Middle Distillates by Mass Spectrometry''
requires the chromatographic separation of the aromatics from the saturates by
chromatography. All these methods allow for the presence of FAMEs in diesel.
Although these methods undoubtedly provide reliable results when applied
intelligently, quantitation by refractive index and mass spectrometric detection
have their problems, which have been reviewed in detail \autocite{Kaminski2005}.
As an example of one of the challenges for RI detection, there is no correlation
between the refractive index of a compound and its chemical structure. Therefore
successful quantitation depends on the precise determination of response
factors. But in a mixture of petrochemicals from different feedstocks the
compounds and their relative quantities are unknown, so the physical meaning of
the determined peak areas is unclear.


Although not specified by SANS 342, ASTM D5186 \autocite{ASTMD5186} is an
SFC-FID method for determining the amount and type of aromatic compounds. In
principle it is similar to the methods prescribed, with three key differences:
it uses neat carbon dioxide at high pressure as a mobile phase, it uses bare
silica as a stationary phase, and it uses flame ionization as a detector (FID).
As discussed in Section \ref{sec:FID}, the FID has an unsurpassed dynamic range
and responds to the primarily to number of carbon atoms, which means that its
signal reflects the mass of the analyte. This makes it a reliable and robust
detector that excels at quantitation.

\subsection{SFC×GC of petrodiesel/biodiesel blends}

The simplicity of coupling GC to SFC has been recognized and used for the
detailed analysis of hydrocarbon groups in diesel \autocite{Pal1998}.

The elution properties of aromatic hydrocarbons on SFC are different from that
of FAMEs. Being polar oxygenates, the FAMEs have a much higher retention than
the aromatic compounds, and the two classes elute completely separately. But,
just as the hydrocarbon compounds elute in order of number of rings, the FAMEs
elute in order of double bonds \autocite{Smith2001}. 

Comprehensively coupling GC to separate fractions of the SFC eluate on a second
dimension will then yield further information that correlates with the molecular
mass of the compounds.

\section{Experimental}

\subsection{Samples} 

A sample was prepared by blending \SI{7}{\percent} of biodiesel from canola
(labelled "rapeseed methyl ester" (RME)) with a commercial low-sulfur diesel.
(\SI{7}{\percent} was chosen to reflect the amount allowed by EN 590, the
European equivalent to EN 342). In a GC×GC-MS analysis the relative percentages
of total ion intensity for different classes of compounds were
\SI{68.19}{\percent} alkanes, \SI{18.10}{\percent} alkenes, \SI{13.69}{\percent}
aromatics and \SI{0.01}{\percent} oxygenates \autocite{Smit2015}.

To determine the relative retention times of aromatic compounds with different
numbers of rings, known amounts of a selection of aromatic compounds were added
(\keyword{spiked}) to a neat sample of the low-sulfur diesel. The retention
times of these compounds will give an indication of how the structure of an
aromatic compound influences its retention time which will aid the 2D
chromatographic pattern interpretation. The compounds and their amounts used in
the spike are listed in Table \ref{tab:Aromatics}

\subsection{SFC}

The injection system described in Section \ref{sec:SFCInjection} was used to
inject a \SI{0.5}{\micro\litre} volume of the undiluted \SI{7}{\percent} blend
and the spiked sample. The SFC used neat carbon dioxide at \SI{200}{\bar} inlet
pressure as mobile phase. The column consisted of five HPLC bare silica columns
(\SI{150}{\milli\metre} $\times$ \SI{4.6}{\milli\metre}, 3 $\mu$m particles)
(Restek, Pinnacle DB Silica) connected in series.

\subsection{Modulation}

For the aromatic portion of the chromatogram SFC eluate fractions of
\SI{3}{\second} were collected on the GC column cooled to a temperature of
\SI{-20}{\celsius} or below. The inlet vent was held closed for \SI{3}{\second}
after the the SFC stop valve closed to allow the last of the eluted fraction to
be swept onto the column, and then opened for \SI{1}{\second} to release excess
pressure.

For the FAMEs portion of the chromatogram the same trapping temperature was
used, but the modulation period was increased to \SI{10}{\second}. This longer
trapping period causes a higher increase in inlet pressure by the eluting carbon
dioxide, which required a vent time of \SI{3}{\second} to release the excess
pressure.

\subsection{GC}

The column used in the fast gas chromatograph was an DB-5MS column from J\&W
Scientific Inc, which has a stationary phase comprised of \SI{5}{\percent}
diphenyl, \SI{95}{\percent} di\-meth\-yl\-poly\-si\-lox\-ane. It was \SI{1}{\metre} long,
with an internal diameter of \SI{0.25}{\milli\metre}. The thickness of the
stationary phase was \SI{0.25}{\micro\metre}, and had an operational temperature
range of \SI{-60}{\celsius} to \SI{325}{\celsius} for isothermal elution, or up
to \SI{350}{\celsius} when using temperature programming.

For every fast GC run the temperature was ramped from \SI{-30}{\celsius} at a
rate of \SI{8000}{\celsius\per\minute} to \SI{25}{\celsius}, and from there to
\SI{350}{\celsius} at a rate of \SI{2000}{\celsius\per\minute}, where it was
maintained for \SI{2}{s}. After the temperature program had ended the column was
cooled to \SI{-20}{\celsius} again and the next fraction was collected. Figure
\ref{fig:Setpoint_Following} shows how well the indicated temperature followed
the temperature program.

indicated temperature, as recorded. The ``steps'' in the orange line is caused
by the \SI{100}{\milli\second} period of the control loop.}

\end{figure}


The detector was an FID at \SI{350}{\celsius}. The FID response was recorded as
fast GC chromatograms and the collected GC chromatograms were used to compile
the 2D chromatogram.

The chromatogram of the biodiesel/petrodiesel blend (Figure \ref{fig:PAH_FAMEs}) shows
that the blend was separated into two distinct groups of compounds. At a \oneD
(SFC) retention time of about \SI{980}{\second} the hydrocarbons from the
petrodiesel part of the blend elutes. To those familiar with petrochemical
chromatography the characteristic unresolved complex mixture (``hydrocarbon
hump'') topped by alkane peaks will be instantly recognizable as representing
a petroleum product. (See Figure \ref{fig:HCHump} for an example.)

Between \SI{980}{\second} and \SI{1200}{\second} a pattern of small peaks elute.
These represent the aromatic fraction of the petrodiesel.

\end{figure}

Between the \textsuperscript{1}D retention times of \SI{2200}{\second} and
\SI{3200}{\second} the peaks of the FAMEs are seen, clearly separated by number
of double bonds in the SFC dimension, and by volatility in the GC dimension.
When compared to Figure \ref{fig:2DCanola}, the pattern is clearly similar, so
the RME is not incorrect.

This separation shows that SFC×GC can be used to investigate the biodiesel
component of petrodiesel/biodiesel blends without sample pre-treatment or
specialized columns. The intrinsic orthogonality provides easy identification of
components and the excess separation space allows for the addition of suitable
internal standards for reliable qualitative and quantitative analysis with the
robust FID with its predictable response. Expensive mass spectrometric detection
is unnecessary

Being able to determine the biodiesel content of biodiesel blends may prove
useful in at least two scenarios: 

The first is in monitoring blending. Biodiesel, essentially a mixture of esters,
is quite polar compared to petrodiesel, essentially a mixture of hydrocarbons.
This means that blending might not be a matter of just pumping the relevant volumes
of the respective fuels into a tank and relying on diffusion to complete the
mixing. Being able to determine the amount of biodiesel in different samples of
a blend will provide assurance that the blend is homogenous and should perform
according to expectations. While such a test is perhaps better performed using a
spectroscopic method, SFC×GC can provide information for calibration, and will
of course be invaluable during trouble shooting.  

The second application of SFC×GC is in regulating biodiesel content. In some
political environments fuels might be taxed according to their
biologically-derived content, for example to promote agriculture or to meet
carbon emissions targets. Sometimes biological content is not encouraged by
taxation, but simply mandated. Such incentives and mandates are of course liable
to corruption, and therefore the ability to monitor the blending of the fuels is
needed. The most reliable way to differentiate between organic matter derived
from biological sources and organic matter derived from fossil sources is a
radiochemical method, where the content of radioactive \textsuperscript{14}C is
determined. (Organic material from fossil sources contains no
\textsuperscript{14}C.) The technical standard ASTM D6866 provides an approved
method. But radiochemical methods require specialized equipment and trained
staff, whereas fuel laboratories more often have experience with chromatographic
techniques and might find SFC×GC a useful technique to provide evidence that a
diesel fuel blend contains the stated amount of biodiesel.

\begin{todo}

Previous work has shown that it is possible to also separate the alkenes from
the alkanes \autocite{Venter1999}, at least in petrol, and that the resolution
can be improved by cooling the column. Further research along these lines might
reveal that is possible to separate the alkenes from the alkanes in diesel. 

\end{todo}

, and might provide a way to quantify the biodiesel component in blends
with petrodiesel, and cost-effective, accurate and reliable quantitation of the
biodiesel component in blends with petrodiesel can be expected.
