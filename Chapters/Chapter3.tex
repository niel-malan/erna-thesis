\section{Introduction to standards}
\label{Sec:Intro}

The fact that vegetable oil can be used to fuel diesel engines has been known
since the earliest days. Rudolf Diesel himself had exhibited an engine at the
Paris Exhibition in 1900 \autocite{Knothe2010} that ran on peanut oil. But the
development of the petroleum industry late in the 19th century ensured an ample
supply of fossil fuel for these engines.

The development of the diesel engine happened in parallel with its fuel, for, as
Cummins said ``\ldots we must never forget that \textit{an engine and the fuel
it consumes are inseparable partners}; the one cannot progress without the full
cooperation of the other'' \autocite{Cummins1989}. The first invention of an
engine presupposes a supply of fuel, but the variation-selection process that
searches for lower costs and higher efficiency then opens up the quest for more
fuels. If new fuels are proposed, meticulous engine builders would then have to
test each new fuel in their engines and approve it. But fuel suppliers would
like to see their fuels used in as many engines as possible. This convergence of
interests gives rise to the establishment of \keyword{technical standards}.
Technical standards allow engine builders to develop engines that will run on
any fuel with certain agreed-upon standard qualities, and fuel producers can
produce fuels knowing that they will work on any engine designed for that fuel.

A technical standard or just \keyword{standard} is a ``document, established by
consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and
repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their
results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given
context'' \autocite{Hatto2010}. Standards are used in many aspects of
industrialized societies, from implantable medical devices \autocite{ISO2019} to
coffins and caskets \autocite{SABS1993}. Standards are often associated with
products, but also apply to procedures \autocite{ISO2015} and systems
\autocite{ISO2017}.

Standards are not mandatory, nor do they provide the `best' way of doing
something. The great strength of standards is their reliability.
``Standards exist principally to provide a reliable basis on which common
expectations can be shared regarding specific characteristics of a product,
service or process'' \autocite{BSI2016}.

Standards are published by \keyword{standards organizations}, which might be
national or international in character, or might be established to serve a
certain industry. Standards organizations are often known by their
abbreviations, and a few of them are listed in Table
\ref{tab:StandardsOrganizations}. The authors of these standards documents are
usually \keyword{technical committees}, comprised of individuals from a wide
variety of stakeholder organizations, who work towards consensus.

\begin{table}
	\caption{A few well-known standards organizations}
	\label{tab:StandardsOrganizations}

	\begin{tabulary}{\textwidth}{LLL}

	\end{tabulary}
\end{table}

Standards have a unique publication system. They are not published by publishing
houses, but by the standards organizations themselves, who sell the documents
directly to end users. Each standard is usually also better known by its number
than by its title. For example, if I were to mention the document entitled
``Quality management systems — Requirements'' few people would know that I'm
talking about the well-known quality system standard usually known as \std{ISO
9001}. To distinguish between standards bodies and their documents, the numbers
of technical standards will be rendered in \textsc{small caps}, \textit{e.g.}
\std{SANS 1935}.

The South African national standards body is the South African Bureau of
Standards (SABS), which was established by an act of parliament,
 Standards Act, 1945 (Act No. 24 of 1945), as amended by the Standards Act, Act
 No. 8 of 2008 \autocite{Act8-2008}. The SABS issues South African National
 Standards.

Standards organizations not only write standards, they might also
\keyword{adopt} them. Adoption happens when a suitable standard has already been
issued by another standards organization. Standards very often refer to other
standards, and standards are often based on published academic research. While
standards are not mandatory, some legislation might refer to standards.

The desire for engine designers for access to a reliable fuel and for fuel
suppliers to have the largest possible market, lead them to cooperate in the
development of standards for fuels. In South Africa the relevant standard for
petroleum-based diesel fuel is \std{SANS 342}, in the USA the equivalent is
\std{ASTM D975}, and in the European Union it is \std{EN 590}. According to the
Petroleum Products Act of 1977, as amended, diesel fuel sold to an end-consumer
must conform to \std{SANS 342}.

Biodiesel is chemically very different from \keyword{petrodiesel} (diesel
derived from fossil sources), and therefore the technical standards of biodiesel
need to be different from the standards for petrodiesel.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: An overview}

The current South African standard applicable to biodiesel is ``South African
National Standard 1935 Automotive biodiesel — Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)
for diesel engines — Requirements and test methods'' \autocite{SANS1935}. This
is an adoption of the European Committee for Standardization's (CEN) standard
\std{EN 14214} \autocite{EN14214}. In the USA the equivalent standard is
\std{ASTM D7651}, which is largely similar but of different heritage.

\std{SANS 1935} consists of 18 pages. The first two pages are unnumbered: for
the purposes of this discussion they will be numbered in small Roman numerals.

\begin{description}


\item[p(i)]{The first page is a title page, following the usual format for SABS
standards. The top line of the page contains the ISBN (978-0-626-26349-2), and
in large type the standard number (SANS 1935:2011). Then follows in capital
letters ``South African National Standards'', and below that the title
``Automotive biodiesel --- Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) for diesel engines
--- Requirements and test methods''. At the bottom edge of the page we find the
SABS logo and some contact information.}

\item[p(ii)]{The second page is an informational page. It starts with a table of
changes, which was still empty at the time of writing. Then follows a foreword
in which the technical committee who approved the standard is acknowledged
(National Committee SABS SC 1018A). It also gives the date of publication
(December 2011) and states that it supersedes \std{SANS 1935:2004}. Then there is a
very significant line, which states that the standard is referenced in the
Petroleum Products Act \autocite{Act120-1997}. }

\item[p4]{Continues the list of normative references.}

\item[p5]{Paragraph 3: This paragraph contains a list of definitions. The most
important one is this: ``biodiesel [is a] fuel comprised of methyl esters of
long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils.'' This is a very specific
description of biodiesel. It excludes animal fats as a source of fatty acids and
it excludes \textit{ethyl} esters. But a note reads ``Consideration for the
inclusion of ethyl esters, animal fats and C8 – C12 carbon chains should be
taken later.'' The significance of ethyl esters is that methyl esters are not
usually ``carbon neutral'', that is, the methanol used in the
transesterification reaction is usually obtained from the petrochemical
industry, whereas ethanol from fermentation (See Section \ref{sec:BioEthanol})
could be carbon neutral.
The definition also rules out hydrotreated vegetable oil (see Section
\ref{sec:GreenDiesel}) or biomass-derived Fischer-Tropsch diesel (see Section
\ref{sec:FT}.}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Properties, requirements and methods.}

On studying \std{SANS 1935}, it quickly becomes clear that the core of the
document is Table 1. This table has three columns. The first column lists a
\keyword{property}, the second column specifies a numerical value the property
has to conform to, the \keyword{requirement}, and the third column prescribes
the \keyword{test method} that must be used to obtain the value.

In the following discussion each of the requirements will be discussed in order
of increasing relevance to this thesis, grouped by method of determination (See
Figure \ref{fig:MindMap}).

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Physical properties}

\subsection{Density}

A diesel engine can only deliver work proportional to the heat of combustion of
the fuel, and for a given chemical composition the energy will be proportional
to the mass of the fuel. But diesel engines inject measured volumes of fuel, not
measured masses. (Fuel is also sold by volume, not mass.) Therefore, the stated
power output of an engine depends on a specified fuel density.

According to \std{SANS 1935} the density of biodiesel is required to be
\SIrange{860}{900}{\kilogram\per\cubic\metre} at a temperature of
\SI{15}{\celsius}. The testing methods that can be used are described in
\std{ISO 3675} and \std{ISO 12185}.


\std{ISO 12185} prescribes the measurement of density by using an electronic
instrument known as the oscillating tube density meter. This measures the
density of a liquid by measuring the frequency of a freely-oscillating tube
filled with the liquid under test. The frequency depends on the mass of the
filled tube, and therefore on the density of the liquid.
These devices are easy to use and very accurate. The temperature of the liquid
is controlled electronically.

\std{ISO 3675} prescribes the use of a hydrometer, which is an instrument that
measures density by measuring the buoyant force on a floating indicator.
According to the law of Archimedes, the buoyant force on a body immersed in a
liquid is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. If the liquid is denser,
the force is greater. Therefore, in a denser liquid a floating indicator will
float with more of the indicator above the surface of the liquid. Hydrometer
technology is mature, and the devices are simple and robust.  If \std{ISO 3675}
is used at a temperature other than the specified one, a temperature correction
is applied, as described in Annex D.

\subsection{Kinematic viscosity}

The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to flow when a force is
applied to it. Kinematic viscosity is the resistance to flow of a liquid when it
experiences the force of gravity. Flow under gravity of course depends on the
density of the liquid, so that kinematic viscosity is determined by measuring
the liquid's viscosity and dividing it by its density. The viscosity of a diesel
fuel is important, because the fuel must be finely divided for rapid combustion.
In the diesel engine this division is achieved by the \keyword{injector}, which
produces a spray of fuel into the cylinder. The fuel droplet size distribution
in the spray is strongly influenced by the fuel's viscosity.

\std{SANS 1935} requires that kinematic viscosity be
\SIrange{3.5}{5.0}{\milli\metre\squared\per\second}. The measurement method is
specified by \std{ISO 3104}, which uses a capillary viscometer: the time taken
for a fixed volume of liquid to flow through a capillary. This time is then
multiplied by an instrument-specific factor to yield the kinematic viscosity.

\section[\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Aggregate properties: Specialized
in\-stru\-mentation]{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Aggregate properties: \\ Specialized
in\-stru\-mentation}

Some of the requirements specified in \std{SANS 1935} are not values that have
direct correspondence to physical or chemical quantities usually used in
science, but are measures that have proved useful in engineering practice.

\subsection{Cetane number}

For a diesel engine to operate according to design the fuel must combust in a
reliable manner. The \keyword{cetane number} is a number that indicates the ease
of ignition of a fuel in a diesel engine. A higher number indicates easier
ignition. Cetane is a synonym for hexadecane, and is a liquid compound that
auto-ignites easily when injected into a diesel engine cylinder at high
compression and temperature. In contrast, its highly branched isomer
2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (also called isocetane, see Figure
\ref{fig:Cetane}) ignites less easily. The intuitively-understood ``ease of
combustion" can be quantified as the \keyword{ignition delay}, the time between
the moment the fuel is injected in to the engine and the moment the ignition
starts. A mixture of the two compounds will have an ignition delay somewhere
between that of the two compounds.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/cetane.pdf}
\decoRule

\caption[Cetane and isocetane]{The chemical structures of the C16 hydrocarbon
isomers cetane and isocetane.}
\label{fig:Cetane}
\end{figure}

\std{SANS 1935} prescribes the test method of \std{ISO 5165}. The cetane number
is obtained by measuring the ignition delay in a highly specialized test engine.
The engine is equipped with the necessary instrumentation to measure ignition
delay. It is a single-piston, four-stroke engine that has a combustion chamber
of variable volume, which gives it a variable compression ratio. While running
on the fuel under test, the compression ratio is changed until a prescribed
ignition delay is achieved. Then the cetane/isocetane mixture that will give the
same ignition delay at that compression ratio is found. If pure cetane will give
the prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number 100 is assigned. If pure
isocetane gives the prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number 0 is
assigned. If it is found that a 50:50 cetane:isocetane mixture produces the
prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number 50 is assigned.

Cetane number gives limited insight into the chemical properties of the fuel or
the performance of an engine using the fuel, but it is a trusted measure of the
suitability of a fuel for use in a diesel engine and is therefore included in
the standard. Biodiesel from common feedstocks usually easily meets the cetane
specifications.

\subsection{Flash point}

Fuels are, naturally, flammable and different fuels are flammable to different
degrees. A fuel's \keyword{flash point} can be used to quantify its degree of
flammability. The flash point is the temperature at which a fuel's vapour at
atmospheric pressure will ignite when it comes in contact with a flame. The
inclusion of flash point in fuel technical standards is not primarily concerned
with the performance of the fuel inside the engine, but is important to know
because it determines how the fuel can safely be handled during transport and
storage \autocite{WFCC2009}.

\std{SANS 1935} specifies that either \std{ISO 2719} (Procedure A) or \std{ISO
3679} be used to determining the flash point of biodiesel. It seems that this
aspect of \std{SANS 1935} is out of date, because \std{ISO 2719:2002} has been
withdrawn and revised by \std{ISO 2719:2016}, which adds a Procedure C,
specifically for FAMEs. \std{ISO 2719} specifies the use of a Pensky-Martin
closed-cup test, an automated device in which a temperature ramp heats an
enclosed amount of liquid, while an ignition source is periodically introduced.
The temperature at which the vapour ignites is the flash point. In \std{ISO
3679} the test procedure is similar, but the prescribed device uses a smaller
volume of liquid and the liquid and its vapour are considered to be in thermal
equilibrium.

\subsection{Oxidation stability}
\label{sec:Rancimat}

Fossil fuels for diesel engines are largely composed of alkanes, which are
chemically very inert. This means that they can be stored for long periods
without significant degradation. Biodiesel, in contrast, is by definition
\autocite[Paragraph 4.1.1]{SANS1935} mostly composed of fatty acids, which are
less inert than alkanes. That fatty acids are liable to oxidation has been known
since antiquity: oils and other fatty foods stored for long periods can go
\keyword{rancid}. In particular, double bonds in the fatty acids will react with
atmospheric oxygen \autocite{Velasco2010} in a series of free radical reactions,
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:RancidRadical}. The hydroperoxides that form are
highly reactive and can react with other fuel compounds to form polymers, soaps
and acids.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/1281px-Lipid_peroxidation.png}
\decoRule

\caption[The peroxidation of lipids.]{The peroxidation of lipids. By Tim
Vickers, after \autocite{Young2001}. Public Domain,
\url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1728531}}

\label{fig:RancidRadical}
\end{figure}

The oxidative stability is measured by the Rancimat, an automated instrument. In
operation it bubbles a stream of hot air through a sample of biodiesel and then
through a conductivity cell filled with deionized water. This air starts
oxidizing the sample. Some of the oxidation products are volatile organic acids,
which dissolve in the water and increase its electrical conductivity. At the
beginning of the test period very few acids are swept into the water, so the
conductivity remains low. As the sample oxidizes and produces acids, the
conductivity of the water slowly increases. But the oxidation reaction is
\keyword{autocatalytic}, which means that the products of the oxidation reaction
accelerates the oxidation. The result of the autocatalysis is that there is a
sudden increase in the slope of the conductivity/time curve. The time taken
until this point is reached is called the \keyword{induction period}.

\std{SANS 1935} requires a minimum induction period of \SI{6}{\minute} at
\SI{110}{\celsius}. Paragraph 4.1.2 permits the addition of antioxidants,
compounds that prevent oxidation.

\subsection{Cold filter plugging point}

The flow of a liquid depends on its temperature. Most obviously, its viscosity
depends on the temperature. But a liquid can freeze, which will also influence
its flow. The operating temperature of a diesel engine is so high that the
temperature of the fuel in the engine will be high enough to guarantee adequate
flow for injection, but the biodiesel needs to be pumped from the fuel tank,
through a fuel filter, to the engine. If crystals of fuel form at low ambient
temperatures, these crystals might plug the pores in the filter, which could
lead to fuel starvation in the engine. It is therefore important that the
biodiesel can be pumped through the engine's fuel filter at all expected
temperatures.

For this purpose \std{SANS 1935} specifies a \keyword{cold filter plugging
point}, measured according to \std{SANS 50116}. It is the lowest temperature at
which a given volume of biodiesel still passes through a standardized filtration
device in a specified time when cooled under certain conditions.

\subsection{Copper strip corrosion}

Many fuel storage  and transfer systems parts and engines parts are made of
metals, and under adverse conditions those parts are susceptible to corrosion.
Corrosion accelerates in chemical environments that include, \textit{inter
alia}, acids, water and oxygen, but corrosion is a complex process, so it is
very difficult to predict which combination of factors will result in
unacceptable corrosion.

\std{SANS 1935} prescribes \std{ISO 2160} as the test for corrosiveness. In this
test a strip of pure copper metal is polished and then immersed in a sample of
the biodiesel at \SI{50}{\celsius} for \SI{3}{\hour}. The degree of corrosion is
judged by visually comparing it to a standard card and then assigning it to a
corrosion class.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Chemical properties: Classical determination}

\subsection{Sulfated ash}

Ash is the solids remaining after the complete combustion of a fuel. This is
measure of the solids that will remain after use. Ash might originate from
suspended solids, soluble metallic soaps, and residual catalyst that form
refractory oxides during combustion. In addition to wear and deposits in the
fuel system associated with ash, it also impairs modern diesel particulate
filters.

\std{SANS 1935} specifies \std{ISO 3987} for the determination of sulfated ash.
For the determination of ash it would not be practical to actually combust the
sample and weigh the residue, because the ash might be carried away, either as
volatile species or as a finely divided aerosol. Therefore the sample is
oxidized using sulphuric acid, and then heated to drive off the sulphuric acid.
The requirement specifies the mass of the metal oxides that remain.

\subsection{Carbon residue}

When a mixture of organic compounds is heated under conditions of low oxygen, it
can form coke. Coke is a solid material composed of practically pure carbon.
Pure, solid carbon will combust, but the reaction is kinetically limited, so it
will only combust slowly under conditions of high temperature and a large excess
of oxygen. If a fuel tends to form coke inside an engine, it can cause problems
in operation. When neat vegetable oil is used as diesel fuel, for example, coke
tends to form on the engine's injectors \autocite{vanderWalt1982}. This coking
can cause problems with fuel injection, which would affect engine performance.
Carbon residue is not a specification based on academic research: from long
experience it has been found to correlate with coking tendencies of oils in the
petroleum industry, and so found its way into the biodiesel standard.

The test method prescribed for testing for carbon residue is \std{ISO 10370}.
This involves heating a sample of biodiesel to high temperature in a crucible in
air, using standardized apparatus. Most of the sample burns off, leaving a
residue. The mass of the residue is determined and reported.

\subsection{Total contamination}

Ideally, biodiesel should be a homogeneous liquid. Some undissolved material can
be tolerated, but too much can plug filters. The amount of undissolved solids is
termed \keyword{total contamination}.

The test of total contamination specified by \std{SANS 1935} is contained in
\std{SANS 52662}, which is synonymous with \std{EN 12662}. In this test total
contamination is determined by obtaining the mass of material retained on a
glass-fibre filter after passage of the biodiesel sample.

\subsection{Acid value}

The end products of oxidative degradation of biodiesel include free organic
acids, so the acidity of biodiesel is a good indicator of its quality. Measuring
the acidity gives an indication of how much the biodiesel has already oxidized,
whereas the oxidation stability (measured by Rancimat, see
Section\ref{sec:Rancimat}) indicates how well the biodiesel will withstand
oxidation on storage.

\std{SANS 1935} specifies the test described in \std{SANS 54104}, which is
equivalent to \std{EN 14104}. This test is a titration with alcoholic KOH of a
sample of biodiesel dissolved in a mixture of solvents. A glass pH electrode
connected to an electronic pH meter is used to follow the titration.

\subsection{Iodine value}

As discussed above (see Section \ref{sec:Rancimat}) the oxidation of biodiesel
is a major quality concern. The tendency of biodiesel to oxidize correlates with
the number of double bonds in the fatty acids, or their \keyword{degree of
unsaturation}.

% t AOCS method Cd 1d-92 using cyclohexane-acetic acid (also used by the
% European standard EN 14111) as solvent system are based on the Wijs solution.

The degree of unsaturation of oils and fats have long been measured by the
\keyword{iodine value}, dating from 1884 \autocite{Knothe2007}. Halogens will
rapidly add to double bonds, so that when a mixture of fatty acids is treated
with a known excess of iodating reagent, the remaining iodine can be titrated to
determine the amount of iodine absorbed by the fatty acids. The iodine value is
the mass of iodine absorbed by 100 mass units of fat or oil.

The relevance of including iodine value in biodiesel standards has been
questioned \autocite{Knothe2002}, because all the information regarding
unsaturation of the fatty acids in biodiesel is contained in chromatographic
data which need to be obtained in other requirements. \std{SANS 1935} seems to
acknowledge this, because Annex A allows that the iodine value can be calculated
from chromatographic results (see Section \ref{sec:ChromDetUnsat}).

Because determining iodine value is a mature technology and therefore relatively
simple, it is tempting to think of it as a test that might be useful to small
biodiesel producers. Unfortunately the iodine value is determined by the
feedstock, so that for a feedstock from a certain vegetable oil crop there is
unlikely to be any significant variation in iodine value, no matter the
production process. Iodine value might be useful as a simple indicator of
feedstock quality when the biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oil, which
might contain a variety of oils from different origins.

The prescribed method for the requirement is \std{SANS 54111} (or, equivalently,
\std{EN 14111}). In this method a known excess of Wijs's reagent (iodine
chloride in acetic acid) is added to a weighed sample. The reaction mixture is
then treated with potassium iodide, which converts the excess ICl to
I\textsubscript{2}, which is then titrated with potassium thiosulfate. The
titration is followed potentiometrically and the equivalence point determined
from the titration curve.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Chemical properties: Electrochemical determination}

\subsection{Water content.}

The compounds that comprise biodiesel are much more polar than those of
petro\-diesel. Therefore, much more water can dissolve in biodiesel than in
petrodiesel. This water has several deleterious effects on the quality of
biodiesel: it encourages the growth of micro-organisms, allows hydrolysis, and
accelerates corrosion. The permitted mass fraction of water specified in the
requirements of \std{SANS 1935} is lower than the solubility of water in
biodiesel, and therefore refers to dissolved water. Free, visible water is
excluded by paragraph 4.1.4.

The method specified by \std{SANS 1935} for the determination of water in
biodiesel is \std{ISO 12937}. This standard prescribes the well-known Karl
Fischer titration used for the determination of water in solvents. This is a
\keyword{coulometric} titration, which means that electricity is used as
titrant. The titration curve is a plot of oxidation potential of a platinum
electrode against the amount of charge (current integrated over time).


\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Chemical properties: Spectroscopic determination}

\subsection{Group I metals}

The most common catalysts in biodiesel production are sodium or potassium
hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) or alkoxides (CH\textsubscript{3}ONa and
CH\textsubscript{3}OK). These catalysts are polar and will dissolve in the
glycerol byproduct of biodiesel production. But some may remain in the biodiesel
itself and need to be removed. This cleanup can be done by washing with water,
adsorbent columns, or selective membranes \autocite{Atadashi2011}.

\std{SANS 54108} is the method specified for the determination of sodium, and
\std{SANS 54109} the method specified for potassium. Both are flame atomic
absorption spectroscopy methods: a sample of the biodiesel is aspirated into a
gas flame, where the sodium and potassium are atomized. The atoms will absorb
light at certain wavelengths and measuring the amount of light absorbed will
give an indication of the amount. Alternatively, \std{EN 14538} may be used to
determine sodium and potassium simultaneously with calcium and magnesium (see
Section \ref{sec:GroupIIMetals}).

\subsection{Group II metals}
\label{sec:GroupIIMetals}

Fatty acids neutralized by alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides form
\keyword{soaps}. If these metals are present in the feedstock, as catalyst, or
in washing water they can form soaps with the fatty acids in the biodiesel.
These soaps can form deposits in engines that can affect operation. For example,
deposits of calcium soaps have been reported to cause injectors to stick
\autocite{Pischinger2000}.

\std{SANS 1935} prescribes \std{EN 14538} as the method for determining Group II
metals. This is an optical emission spectroscopy method: a sample of the
biodiesel is diluted in kerosene, and injected into a inductively coupled argon
plasma. The emission intensities at certain wavelengths are compared to the
emission intensities of solvents containing known concentrations of the metals.

\subsection{Phosphorus}

Phosphorus expected in biodiesel should not affect a diesel engine's
performance, but it can have a detrimental effect on the exhaust treatment
system by forming ash that can clog filters and reactive species that can reduce
catalyst effectiveness. Trace levels of phosphorus will be expected in biodiesel
in the bound form of phospholipids found in the feedstock. Normal biodiesel
feedstock and production methods should yield biodiesel with acceptable
phosphorus concentration, but inorganic phosphorus might be present in biodiesel
produced from used cooking oil.
 
\std{SANS 54107} is the prescribed method for determining phosphorus in
biodiesel. A sample of biodiesel is dissolved in xylene, and the solution
introduced in aerosol form into an inductively coupled argon plasma. The high
temperature of the plasma causes phosphorus atoms and/or ions to emit radiation.
This emission is measured at a certain wavelength and compared to emissions from
solutions with known concentrations.

\subsection{Sulfur}

The amount of sulfur in biodiesel is limited not because it affects the fuel's
performance, but because the fuel must be compatible with emission control
systems and must not emit more sulfur than petrodiesel. Most biodiesel
feedstocks are naturally low in sulfur and are therefore unlikely to exceed the
limits.

\std{SANS 1935} offers two alternative tests for sulfur. \std{ISO 20846} is a UV
fluorescence method, while \std{ISO 20884} is an X-ray fluorescence methods. The
quantum-mechanical mechanism is the same for both methods: a chemical species
absorbs energy from a photon which puts it in an activated state. The species
then returns to a state of lower energy, emitting a photon of different energy.
In the case of \std{ISO 20846} the species is gaseous SO\textsubscript{2}
(obtained by combusting the sample), and the activating photons are from the
ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the case of \std{ISO 20884}
the chemical species are the bound forms of sulfur as found in the biodiesel,
and the activating photons are from the X-ray region of the electromagnetic
spectrum.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935}: Chemical properties: Chromatographic determination}
\label{sec:ChromDet}

\subsection{Methanol content}

Methanol in biodiesel increases its flash point and is an indicator of poor
production process control.

\std{SANS 1935} requires a maximum mass fraction of \SI{0.2}{\percent} of
methanol in biodiesel. The prescribed test method is contained in \std{SANS
54110}, and involves heating a sealed vial partly filled with biodiesel to
\SI{80}{\celsius}. A portion of the headspace vapour is taken and injected into
a gas chromatograph. The amount of methanol is quantified by comparing the
methanol peak to either an internal or external standard.

\subsection{Ester content}
\label{sec:EsterContent}
As prescribed in Paragraph 3 of \std{SANS 1935}, biodiesel must consist of fatty
acid methyl esters. The first line of Table 1 quantifies this requirement as a
minimum of \SI{96.5}{\percent} mass fraction.

The specified method is \std{SANS 54103}. This document refers to \std{ISO
5508:1990}, which has been withdrawn and superseded by \std{ISO 12966-4:2015}.
\std{ISO 5508} and \std{ISO 12966} describe gas chromatographic methods for the
determination of FAMEs. \std{ISO 5508} is obsolete: it gives conditions for
packed GC columns and thermal conductivity detectors, two technologies which are
now rarely found in the chromatography laboratory. Both methods, however,
require polar stationary phases. The quantity of esters is determined by
integrating all the peaks in a certain retention time window and comparing it to
the peak area of an internal standard.

\subsection{Glyceride content}
\label{sec:Glycerides}

Glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) is the ``backbone'' of the oil molecules that
constitute the feedstock for biodiesel production. Each hydroxyl group can form
an ester bond with a fatty acid, and when each of the three have a fatty acid
bound to it the compound is an `oil molecule'. IUPAC recommends that such a
molecule be called a tri-O-acylglycerol \autocite{Nic2009}, but by
long-established custom they are called triglycerides. The conversion of a
triglyceride to FAMEs is a stepwise process, with one ester bond at a time being
methanolized. This means that during the reaction process, there will also be
di- and monoglycerides (di- and mono-O-acylglycerols) in the reaction mixture.
If the reaction is not controlled to ensure that the reaction goes to
completion, these glycerides will be found in the final product. Apart from
being an indicator of an incomplete transesterification reaction, the presence
of glycerides has further negative effects: during cold weather or in blends
with petrodiesel, some dissolved impurities might precipitate, in particular the
monoglycerides \autocite{Dunn2009,Plata2015}. This precipitate might block
filters or otherwise interfere with engine performance.

\std{SANS 1935} specifies that the mono-, di- and triglyceride content of
biodiesel must be determined by a procedure compliant with \std{SANS 54105} (or,
equivalently, \std{EN 14105}). In this method, the biodiesel sample is treated
with MSTFA (2,2,2-Tri\-fluoro-N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide) before
separation by GC. MSTFA is a \keyword{derivatization reagent}: It reacts with
the hydroxyl groups in the glycerides to form trimethylsilyl derivatives, as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:MSTFA}. The molecule is then much more inert and will
not interact with the stationary phase support, yielding peaks with better
shapes.

\begin{figure}

\caption[Derivitization]{The derivitization of a diglyceride with
N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). During GC the inert
trimethylsilyl group does not interact with the stationary support,
and the volatile trifluoroacetamide elutes with the solvent front.}

\label{fig:MSTFA}
\end{figure}

The trifluoroacetamide group is a good leaving group, and upon nucleophilic
attack by the hydroxyl oxygen its bond with the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group is
cleaved, leaving the TMS bound to the oxygen. The labile hydrogen atom is now
replaced by the TMS group, which is inert and will not interact with polar
entities in the stationary phase or column, which will lead to improved peak
shapes.

\subsection{Free glycerol}

Free glycerol is one of the products of the transesterification of plant oils to
produce biodiesel. It is a polar compound, which naturally separates from the
non-polar biodiesel, and any excess remaining dissolved in the biodiesel is
removed during the washing step. Inappropriate processing may leave excess free
glycerol in the biodiesel. Free glycerol contributes to injector coking,
therefore determining free glycerol is an important quality-control step.

Free glycerol can be determined by the same chromatographic procedure prescribed
for the determination of the other glycerides in \std{SANS 54105} (see Section
\ref{sec:Glycerides}), but \std{SANS 1935} also offers the option of \std{SANS
54016}. This standard uses a liquid-liquid extraction of biodiesel with a
mixture of ethanol, water, and hexane. The free glycerol transfers
quantitatively to the bottom layer, which is then analysed with a gas
chromatographic method. The benefit of this method is that the resulting
chromatogram has only one peak, that of glycerol, so quantification is
straightforward. The column specified in \std{SANS 54106} method is a
\keyword{porous layer open tubular} (PLOT) column, \textit{i.e.} a capillary
lined on the inside with a layer of particles coated with the stationary phase,
in this case a polar polyethylene glycol.

\subsection{Polyunsaturated methyl esters}
\label{sec:ChromDetUnsat}

The degree of unsaturation of the constituent fatty acids is the main
determinant of the oxidative stability of biodiesel. \std{SANS 1935} limits the
amount of highly unsaturated FAMEs by two lines in Table 1. In particular, the
amount of methyl linoleate is limited to less than \SI{12}{\percent} mass
fraction, and the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters with four
or more double bonds is limited to less than \SI{1}{\percent} mass fraction.

\subsubsection{Linolenic acid methyl ester}

The prescribed method for the determination of methyl linolenate (C18:3) is
\std{SANS 54103}, the same method as prescribed for total esters (see Section
\ref{sec:EsterContent}).

\subsubsection{Highly unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters}

\keyword{Polyunsatured fatty acids} (PUFAs) with more than four double bonds are
not commonly found in plant oils, but are found in algae. Fish that feed on
algae accumulate these oils, so that they are also found in fish oils, but fish
oil is not a sustainable resource and should not be used for fuel
\autocite{Kitessa2014}. PUFAs are also highly oxidatively unstable, and
therefore undesirable in biodiesel.

The method prescribed for the determination of PUFA FAMEs is \std{EN 15779}.
This method uses a capillary column with a polyethylene glycol stationary phase.

\section{Comparison of \texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 1935}}{SANS 1935} and \texorpdfstring{\std{SANS 342}}{SANS 342}}

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:Comparison}

\std{SANS 1935} sets the standard for neat biodiesel or biodiesel blendstock in
South Africa and \std{SANS 342} sets the standard for petrodiesel. As can be
expected, there is considerable overlap of the requirements of petrodiesel and
biodiesel, summarized in Figure \ref{fig:Venn}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Venn.pdf}
\decoRule

\caption[Overlap of requirements ]{The overlap of requirements of \std{SANS
1935} for biodiesel and \std{SANS 342} for petrodiesel. PAHs: Polycyclic

Polyunsaturated fatty acids, C18:3: Methyl linolenate, FAMEs: Fatty
Acid Methyl Esters, CFPP: Cold filter plugging point.}

\label{fig:Venn}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison}
There are \num{5} requirements for petrodiesel in \std{SANS 342} that have no
equivalents in \std{SANS 1935}. The first two, labelled ``Distillation'' and
''Recovery'' are borrowed from petroleum engineering tests, and are intended to
ensure an appropriate volatility range. These two tests fall outside the scope
of this discussion.

\subsubsection{PAHs}
The amount of \keyword{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons} (PAHs) in petrodiesel
is limited by \std{SANS 342} to help control their levels in the environment.
PAHs have many sources, including uncombusted petrodiesel.

\subsubsection[FAMEs by IR]{Determining FAMES in blends by IR} The Petroleum
Products Act allows the blending of up to \SI{5}{\percent} of biodiesel with
petrodiesel without the need to label it explicitly as a biodiesel blend. The
method prescribed by \std{SANS 342} for determining the FAMEs in petrodiesel is
\std{EN 14078}. This is an infrared (IR) spectrophotometry method: the amount of
infrared radiation absorbed by a sample of diesel is compared to the radiation
absorbed by solutions containing known amounts of FAMEs. This method is based on
the strong absorption of IR the carbonyl group at \SI{1745}{\per\centi\metre};
of course every fatty acid contains a carbonyl group. Petrodiesel exhibits low
absorbance at this wavelength, because petrodiesel contains only trace levels of
compounds with carbonyl groups. While this spectroscopic test method can be made
very simple, its accuracy depends on certain assumptions about the sample, which
might not be valid \autocite{Pinho2014}.

\subsubsection{Lubricity}
The pumps in modern diesel engines generate pressures of up to \SI{2500}{\bar},
which imply that the mechanical parts exert large forces on each other.
Metal parts that transmit large forces need to be lubricated to limit wear to
acceptable rates. Some of these pump parts are immersed in the fuel, and can
therefore not be conventionally lubricated: the circulating fuel will rapidly
dissolve and sweep away any grease or lubricating oil. Therefore, the
lubrication depends on the lubricating properties of the fuel itself.
\keyword{Lubricity} is a measure of the lubricating properties of a fuel. It is
an aggregate property, and it is quantified by the \keyword{wear scar} caused
when two metal test parts of specified shape are rubbed against each other with
a specified force for a specified duration, while being lubricated by the liquid
under test. Such tests are done using special-purpose test machines.

\std{SANS 1935} contains no lubricity requirement, because it has been found
that biodiesel always provides adequate lubricity. Also, biodiesel can be used
as a lubricity improver in ultra-low-sulphur petrodiesel that might not meet the
requirement. This lubricity is not provided by the FAMEs, but by polar
impurities in the biodiesel, such as free fatty acids and monoglycerides
\autocite{Knothe2005}.

\section{Conclusion: room for innovation.}

The diversity of chromatographic biodiesel quality control methods implies that
the compliance with \std{SANS 1935} can be expensive. To comply, a biodiesel
producer will have to submit samples of biodiesel to at least four different
kinds of chromatographic analysis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \std{EN 14105} for free and total glycerol
  \item \std{EN 14103} for FAME and methyl linoleate content
  \item \std{EN 14110} for residual methanol 
  \item \std{EN 15779} for highly unsaturated FAMEs
  \item (Optionally) \std{EN 14106} for free glycerol
\end{itemize}

This might prove costly, and there has been at least one innovation to reduce
the number of instruments required \autocite{McCurry2009}.

As was emphasized in the introduction to this chapter (see Section
\ref{Sec:Intro}), standards are not `the best' way of determining a certain
desirable property of biodiesel, they are merely trusted methods. As improved
methods are developed and become trustworthy, they can be adopted as
alternatives. As far as biodiesel is concerned, it seems that there is ample
room for chromatographers to innovate and develop improved methods and
instrumentation. This was the motivation for selecting biodiesel as a practical
challenge for developing SFC×GC.
