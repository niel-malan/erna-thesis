\section{Introduction to standards}
\label{Sec:Intro}

The fact that vegetable oil can be used to fuel Diesel engines has been known
since the earliest days. Rudolf Diesel himself had exhibited an engine at the
Paris Exhibition in 1998 \autocite{Knothe2010} that ran on peanut oil. But the
development of the petroleum industry late in the 19th century ensured an ample
supply of fossil fuel for these engines.

The development of the diesel engine happened in parallel with the developing
diesel fuel, for, as Cummins said ``\ldots we must never forget that \textit{an
engine and the fuel it consumes are inseparable partners}; the one cannot
progress without the full cooperation of the other'' \autocite{Cummins1989}. The
first invention of an engine presupposes a supply of fuel, but the
variation-selection process that searches for lower costs and higher efficiency
then opens up the quest for more fuels. If a possible fuel is found, meticulous
engine builders would then have to test each new fuel in their engines and
approve of it. But fuel suppliers would like to see their fuels used in as many
engines as possible. This convergence of interests gives rise to the
establishment of \textit{technical standards}. Technical standards allows engine
builders to develop engines that will run on any fuel with certain agreed-upon
standard qualities, and fuel producers can produce fuels knowing that they will
work on any engine designed for that fuel. 

A technical standard or just \textit{standard} is a ``document, established by
consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for common and
repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their
results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given
context'' \autocite{Hatto2010}. Standards are used in many aspects of
industrialized societies, from implantable medical devices \autocite{ISO2019} to
coffins and caskets \autocite{SABS1993}. Standards are often associated with
products, but also apply to procedures \autocite{ISO2015} and systems
\autocite{ISO2017}.

Standards are not mandatory, nor do they provide the `best' way of doing
something. The great strength of standards are their reliability.
``Standards exist principally to provide a reliable basis on which common
expectations can be shared regarding specific characteristics of a product,
service or process'' \autocite{BSI2016}.

Standards are published by \textit{standards organizations}, which might
be national or international in character, or might be established to serve a
certain industry. Standards organizations are often known by their
abbreviations, and a few of them are listed in Table
\ref{tab:StandardsOrganizations}. The authors of these standards documents are
usually \keyword{technical committees}, comprised of individuals from a wide
variety of stakeholder organizations, who work towards consensus.

\begin{table}
	\caption{A few well-known standards organizations}

	\bottomrule\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Standards have a unique publication system. They are not published by publishing
houses, but by the standards organizations themselves, who sell the documents
directly to end users. Each standard is usually also better known by its number
than by its title. For example, if I were to mention the document entitled
``Quality management systems — Requirements'' few people would know that I'm
talking about the well-known quality system standard usually known as ISO 9001.

The South African national standards body is the South African Bureau of
Standards (SABS), which was established by an act of parliament,
 Standards Act, 1945 (Act No. 24 of 1945)), as amended by the Standards Act, Act
 No. 8 of 2008 \autocite{Act8-2008}. The SABS issues South African National
 Standards.

Standards organizations not only write standards, they might also
\keyword{adopt} them. Adoption happens when a suitable standard has already been
issued by another standards organization. Standards very often refer to other
standards, and standards are often based on published research. While standards
are not mandatory, some legislation might refer to 

The desire for engine designers for access to a reliable fuel and for fuel
suppliers to have the largest possible market lead them to cooperate in the
development of standards for fuels. In South Africa the relevant standard for
petroleum-based diesel fuel is SANS 342, and in the USA the equivalent is ASTM
D975.

Biodiesel is chemically very different from \keyword{petrodiesel} (diesel
derived from fossil sources), and therefore the technical standards of biodiesel
need to be different from the standards for petrodiesel.

\section{SANS 1935: An overview}

The current South African standard applicable to biodiesel is ``South African
National Standard 1935 Automotive biodiesel — Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME)
for diesel engines — Requirements and test methods.'' \autocite{SANS1935} This
is an adoption of the European Committee for Standardization's (CEN) standard EN
14214 \autocite{EN14214}. In the USA is the equivalent standard is ASTM D 7651,
which is largely similar but of different heritage.

SANS 1935 consists of a 18 pages. The first two pages are unnumbered: for the
purposes of this discussion they will be numbered in small Roman numerals.

\begin{description}


\item[p(i)]{The first page is a title page, following the usual format for SABS
standards. The top line of the page contains the ISBN (978-0-626-26349-2), and
in large type the standard number (SANS 1935:2011). Then follows in capital
letters ``South African National Standards'', and below that the title
``Automotive biodiesel --- Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) for diesel engines
--- Requirements and test methods''. At the bottom edge of the page we find the
SABS logo and some contact information.}

\item[p(ii)]{The second page is an informational page. It starts with a table of
changes, which was still empty at the time of writing. Then follows a foreword,
in which the technical committee who approved the standard is acknowledged
(National Committee SABS SC 1018A). It also gives the date of publication
(December 2011) and states that it supersedes SANS 1935:2004. Then there's very
significant line, which states that the standard is referenced in the Petroleum
Products Act \autocite{Act120-1997}. }

\item[p4]{Continues the list of normative references}

\item[p5]{Paragraph 3: This paragraph contains a list of definitions. The most
important one is this: ``biodiesel [is a] fuel comprised of methyl esters of
long chain fatty acids derived from vegetable oils.'' This is a very specific
description of biodiesel. It eliminates animal fats as a source of fatty acids,
and it excludes methyl esters. But a note reads ``Consideration for the
inclusion of ethyl esters, animal fats and C8 – C12 carbon chains should be
taken later.'' The significance of ethyl esters is that methyl esters are not
usually carbon neutral. The methanol used in the transesterification reaction is
usually obtained from the petrochemical industry, whereas ethanol from
fermentation (See Section \ref{sec:BioEthanol}) could be carbon neutral. The
definition also rules out hydrotreated vegetable oil (see Section
\ref{sec:GreenDiesel}) or biomass-derived Fischer-Tropsch diesel (see Section

\section{SANS 1935: Properties, requirements and methods.}

On studying SANS 1935, it quickly becomes clear that the core of the document
is Table 1. This table has three columns. The first column lists a
\keyword{property}, the second column specifies a numerical value the property
has to conform to, the \keyword{requirement}, and the third column prescribes
the \keyword{test method} that must be used to obtain the value.

In the following discussion each of the requirements will be discussed, in order
of increasing relevance to this thesis, grouped by method of determination (See
Figure \ref{fig:MindMap}).

biodiesel assessed by SANS 1935 is grouped for the purpose of discussion in this
chapter.}

\end{figure}

\section{SANS 1935: Physical properties}

\subsection{Density}

A diesel engine can only deliver work proportional to the heat of combustion of
the fuel, and for a given chemical composition the energy will be proportional
to the mass of the fuel. But diesel engines inject measures volumes of fuel, not
measured masses. Therefore, an engine designer must specify the density of the
fuel to specify the power output of the engine.

According to SANS 1935 the density of biodiesel is required to be
\SIrange{860}{900}{\kilogram\per\cubic\metre} at at temperature of
\SI{15}{\celsius}. The methods that can be used is described in ISO 3675 and ISO
12185.

ISO 12185 prescribes the measurement of density by using an electronic
instrument known as the oscillating tube density meter. This measures the
density of a liquid by measuring the mechanical vibrational frequency of a
freely-oscillating tube filled with the liquid under test. The frequency depends
on the weight of the filled tube, and therefore on the density of the liquid.
These devices are easy to use and very accurate. The temperature of the liquid
is controlled electronically.

ISO 3675 prescribes the use of a hydrometer, which is an instrument that
measures density by measuring the buoyant force on a floating indicator.
According to the law of Archimedes, the buoyant force on a body immersed in a
liquid is equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. If the liquid is denser,
the force is greater. Therefore, in a denser liquid a floating indicator will
float with more of the indicator above the surface of the liquid. Hydrometer
technology is mature, and the devices are simple and robust.  If ISO 3675 is
used at a temperature other than the specified one, a temperature correction is
applied, as described in Annex D.

\subsection{Kinematic viscosity}

The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance to flow when a force is
applied to it. Kinematic viscosity is the resistance to flow of a liquid when
the force of gravity is applied to it. This flow of course depends on the
density of the liquid, so that kinematic viscosity is determined by measuring
the liquid's viscosity and dividing it by its density. It is important that the
fuel for a diesel engine have the right viscosity, because the fuel must be
finely divided for rapid combustion. The size of the droplets of fuel in the
spray produced by the engine's injectors is strongly influenced by the fuel's viscosity. 

SANS 1935 requires that kinematic viscosity be in the \SIrange{3.5}{5.0}. The
measurement is specified by ISO 3104, which uses a capillary viscometer: the
time taken for a fixed volume of liquid to flow through a capillary. This time
is them multiplied by an instrument-specific factor to yield the kinematic
viscosity.

\section[SANS 1935: Aggregate properties: Specialized in\-stru\-mentation]{SANS
1935: Aggregate properties: \\ Specialized in\-stru\-mentation}

Some of the requirements specified in SANS 1935 are not values that have direct
correspondence to physical or chemical quantities usually used in science, but
are measures that have proved useful in practice.

\subsection{Cetane number}

For a diesel engine to operate according to design the fuel must combust in a
reliable manner. The cetane number is a number that indicates the ease of
ignition of a fuel in a diesel engine. Cetane is a synonym for hexadecane, and
is a liquid compound that ignites easily when injected into a diesel engine. In
contrast, its highly branched isomer 2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane (also
called isocetane, see Figure \ref{fig:Cetane}) ignites less easily. The
intuitively-understood ``ease of combustion" can be quantified as the
\keyword{ignition delay}, the time between the moment the fuel is injected in to
the engine and the moment the ignition starts. A mixture of the two compounds
will have an ignition delay somewhere between that of the two compounds. A
higher number indicates easier ignition.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/cetane.pdf}
\decoRule

\caption[Cetane and isocetane]{The chemical structures of the C16 hydrocarbon
isomers cetane and isocetane.}
\label{fig:Cetane}
\end{figure}

SANS 1935 prescribes the test method of ISO 5165. The cetane number is obtained
by measuring the ignition delay in a highly specialized test engine. The engine
is equipped with the necessary instrumentation to measure ignition delay. It is
a single-piston, four-stroke engine that has a combustion chamber of variable
volume, which gives it a variable compression ratio. While running on the fuel
under test, the compression ratio is changed until a prescribed ignition delay
is achieved. Then the cetane/isocetane mixture that will give the same ignition
delay at that compression ratio is found. If pure cetane will give the
prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number 100 is assigned. If pure
isocetane gives the prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number 0 is
assigned. If it is found that a 50:50 cetane:isocetane mixture produces the
prescribed ignition delay, then the cetane number of 50 is assigned.

Cetane number gives limited insight into the chemical properties of the fuel, or
indeed, engine performance. But it is a trusted measure of the suitability of a
fuel for use in a diesel engine and is therefore included in the standard.
Biodiesel from common feedstocks usually easily meets the cetane specifications.

\subsection{Flash point}

Fuels are, naturally, flammable, and different fuels are flammable to different
degrees. A fuel's \keyword{flash point} can be used to quantify its degree of
flammability. The flash point is the temperature at which a fuel's vapour will
ignite when it comes in contact with a flame. 

The measurement of flash point is not primarily concerned with the performance
of the fuel inside the engine, but is important to know because it determines
how the fuel can be safely be handled during transport and storage
\autocite{WFCC2009}.

SANS 1935 specifies that either ISO 2719 (Procedure A) or ISO 3679 be used for
determining the flash point. It seems that this aspect of SANS 1935 is out of
date, because ISO 2719:2002 has been withdrawn and revised by ISO 2719:2016,
which adds a Procedure C, specifically for FAME. ISO 2719 specifies the use of a
Pensky-Martin closed-cup test, and automated device in which a temperature ramp
heats an enclosed amount of liquid, while an ignition source is periodically
introduced. The temperature at which the vapour ignites is the flash point. ISO
3679's test procedure works on a similar principle, but the device uses a
smaller volume of liquid, and the liquid and its vapour are considered to be in
thermal equilibrium.

\subsection{Oxidation stability}
\label{sec:Rancimat}

Fossil fuels for diesel engines are largely composed of alkanes, which are
chemically very inert. This means that they can be stored for long periods
without significant degradation. Biodiesel, in contrast, is by definition
\autocite[Paragraph 4.1.1]{SANS1935} mostly composed of fatty acids, which are
less inert than alkanes. This instability has been known since antiquity as
fatty food going \keyword{rancid}. In particular, double bonds in the fatty
acids are liable to reactions with atmospheric oxygen \autocite{Velasco2010}.
These are free radical reactions, illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:RancidRadical}.
The hydroperoxides that form are highly reactive and can react with other fuel
compounds to form polymers, soaps and acids.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/1281px-Lipid_peroxidation.png}
\decoRule

\caption[The peroxidation of lipids.]{The peroxidation of lipids. By Tim
Vickers, after \autocite{Young2001}. Public Domain,
\url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=1728531}}

\label{fig:RancidRadical}
\end{figure}

The oxidative stability is measured by the Rancimat, an automated instrument. It
works by bubbling a stream of hot air through a sample of biodiesel. This air is
then passed through a conductivity measuring cell filled with deionized water.
The conductivity of the water increases when volatile acids dissolves in it. At
the beginning of the test period there are very few acids swept into the water,
so the conductivity remains low. As the sample oxidizes and produce acids, the
conductivity of the water slowly increases. But the oxidation reaction is
\keyword{autocatalytic}, which means that the products of the oxidation reaction
accelerates the oxidation. The result of the autocatalysis is that on the
conductivity curve there is a sudden increase in conductivity. The time taken
until this point is reached is called the \keyword{induction period}.

SANS 1935 requires a minimum induction period of 6 minutes at
\SI{110}{\celsius}. Paragraph 4.1.2 permits the addition of antioxidants,
compounds that prevent oxidation.

\subsection{Cold filter plugging point}

The flow of a liquid depends on its temperature. Most obviously, its viscosity
depend on the temperature. But a liquid can freeze, which will also influence
its flow. The operating temperature of a diesel engine is so high that the
temperature of the fuel in the engine will be high enough to guarantee adequate
flow for injection, but the biodiesel needs to be pumped from the fuel tank,
through a fuel filter, to the engine. If crystals of fuel form at low
temperatures, these crystals might plug the pores in the filter, which could
lead to fuel starvation in the engine. It is therefore important that the
biodiesel must be able to be pumped through the engine's fuel filter at all
expected temperatures.

For this purpose SANS 1935 specifies a \keyword{cold filter plugging point},
measured according to SANS 50116. It is the lowest temperature at which a given
volume of biodiesel still passes through a standardized filtration device in a
specified time when cooled under certain conditions. 

\subsection{Copper strip corrosion}

Many fuel storage  and transfer systems parts and engines parts are made of
metals, and under adverse conditions those parts are susceptible to corrosion.
Chemical conditions that make corrosion more likely include acidity, water, and
oxygen, but corrosion is a complex process, so it is very difficult to predict
which combination of factors will result in unacceptable corrosion.

SANS 1935 prescribes ISO 2160 as the test for corrosiveness. In this test a
strip of pure copper metal is polished and then immersed in a sample of the
biodiesel at \SI{50}{\celsius} for \SI{3}{\hour}. The degree of corrosion is
judged by visually comparing it to a standard card and then assigning it to a
corrosion class.

\section{SANS 1935: Chemical properties: Classical determination}

\subsection{Sulfated ash}

Ash is the solids remaining after the complete combustion of a fuel. This is
measure of the solids that will remain after use. Ash might originate from
suspended solids, soluble metallic soaps, and residual catalyst that form
refractory oxides during combustion. In addition to wear and deposits in the
fuel system associated with ash, it also impairs modern diesel particulate
filters.

SANS 1935 specifies ISO 3987 for the determination of sulfated ash. For the
determination of ash it would not be practical to actually combust the sample
and weigh the residue, because the ash might be carried away, either as volatile
species or as a finely divided aerosol. Therefore the sample is oxidized using
sulphuric acid, and then heated to drive off the sulphuric acid. What remains is
metal oxides, which can be weighed.

\subsection{Carbon residue}

When a mixture of organic compounds is heated under conditions of low oxygen, it
can form coke. Coke is a material that is practically pure carbon. Pure, solid
carbon will combust, but the reaction is kinetically limited, so it will only
combust slowly under conditions of high temperature and a large excess of
oxygen. If a fuel tends to form coke inside an engine, it can cause problems in
operation. Vegetable oil as diesel fuel, for example, tend to form coke on the
injectors \autocite{vanderWalt1982}. This coking can cause problems with injection,
which would affect engine performance. Carbon residue is not a scientific
measure: from long experience it has been found to correlate with coking
tendencies of oils in the petroleum industry, and so found its way into the
biodiesel standard.

The test method prescribed for testing for carbon residue is ISO 10370. This
involves heating a sample of biodiesel to high temperature in a crucible in air,
using standardized apparatus. Most of the sample burns off, leaving a residue.
The mass of the residue is determined and reported.

\subsection{Total contamination}

Ideally, biodiesel should be a homogeneous liquid. Some undissolved material can
be tolerated, but too much can plug filters.

SANS 1935 specifies the test SANS 52662, which is synonymous with EN 12662. In
this test total contamination is determined by filtering a sample of the
biodiesel being tested through a glass-fibre filter, and determining the mass of the
retained material.

\subsection{Acid value}

The end products of oxidation of biodiesel includes free organic acids, so the
acidity of biodiesel is a good indicator of its quality. Measuring the acidity
gives an indication of how much the biodiesel has already oxidized, whereas the
oxidation stability (measured by Rancimat, see Section\ref{sec:Rancimat})
indicates how well the biodiesel will withstand oxidation on storage.

SANS 1935 specifies the test described in SANS 54104, which is equivalent to EN
14104. This test is a titration of a sample of biodiesel dissolved in a
mixture solvents with alcoholic KOH. A glass pH electrode is used to follow the
titration.

\subsection{Iodine value}

As discussed above (see Section \ref{sec:Rancimat}) the oxidation of biodiesel
is a major quality concern. The tendency of biodiesel to oxidize correlates with
the number of double bonds in the fatty acids, or their \keyword{degree of
unsaturation}.

% t AOCS method Cd 1d-92 using cyclohexane-acetic acid (also used by the
% European standard EN 14111) as solvent system are based on the Wijs solution.

The degree of unsaturation of oils and fats have long been measured by the
\keyword{iodine value}, dating from 1884 \autocite{Knothe2007}. Halogens will
rapidly add to double bonds, so that when a mixture of fatty acids is treated
with a known excess of iodating reagent, the remaining iodine can be titrated to
determine the amount of iodine absorbed by the fatty acids. The iodine value is
the mass of iodine absorbed by 100 mass units of fat or oil.

The relevance of including iodine value in biodiesel standards has been
questioned \autocite{Knothe2002}, because all the information regarding
unsaturation of the fatty acids in biodiesel is contained in chromatographic
data which need to be obtained in other requirements. SANS 1935 seems to
acknowledge this, because Annex A allows that the iodine value can be calculated
from chromatographic results (see Section \ref{sec:ChromDetUnsat}).

Because determining iodine value is a mature technology and therefore relatively
simple, it is tempting to think of it as a test that might be useful to small
biodiesel producers. Unfortunately the iodine value is determined by the
feedstock, so that for a feedstock from a certain vegetable oil crop there is
unlikely to be any significant variation in iodine value, no matter the
production process. Iodine value might be useful as a simple indicator of
feedstock quality when the biodiesel is produced from waste vegetable oil, which
might contain a variety of oils from different origins.

The prescribed method for the requirement is SANS 54111 (or, equivalently, EN
14111). In this method a known excess of Wijs's reagent (iodine chloride in
acetic acid) is added to a weighed sample. The reaction mixture is then treated
with potassium iodide, which converts the excess ICl to I\textsubscript{2},
which is then titrated with potassium thiosulfate. The titration is followed
potentiometrically and the equivalence point determined from the titration
curve.

\section{SANS 1935: Chemical properties: Electrochemical determination}

\subsection{Water content.}

The compounds that comprise biodiesel are much more polar than those of
petro\-diesel. Therefore, much more water can dissolve in biodiesel than can
dissolve in petrodiesel. This water has several deleterious effects on the
quality of biodiesel. It encourages the growth of micro-organisms, allows
hydrolysis, and accelerates corrosion.

The level of water specified in the requirements of SANS 1935 is lower than the
solubility of water, and therefore refers to dissolved water. Free, visible
water is excluded by paragraph 4.1.4.

The method specified by SANS 1935 for the determination of water in biodiesel is
ISO 12937. This standard prescribes the well-known Karl Fischer titration used
for the determination of water in solvents. This is a \keyword{coulometric}
titration, which means that electricity is used as titrant. The titration curve
is a plot of oxidation potential of a platinum electrode against the amount of
charge (current integrated over time). 



\section{SANS 1935: Chemical properties: Spectroscopic determination}

\subsection{Group I metals}

The most common catalysts in biodiesel production are sodium or potassium
hydroxides (NaOH and KOH) or alkoxides (CH\textsubscript{3}ONa and
CH\textsubscript{3}OK). These catalysts are polar and will dissolve in the
glycerol byproduct of biodiesel production. But some may remain in the biodiesel
itself, and needs to be removed. This cleanup can be done by washing with water,
adsorbent columns, or selective membranes \autocite{Atadashi2011}.

SANS 54108 is the method specified for the determination of sodium, and SANS
54109 the method specified for potassium. Both are flame atomic absorption
spectroscopy methods: a sample of the biodiesel is aspirated into a gas flame,
where the sodium and potassium are atomized. The atoms will absorb light at
certain wavelengths, and measuring the amount of light absorbed will give a
measure of the amount. Alternatively, EN 14538 may be used to determine sodium
and potassium simultaneously with calcium and magnesium (see Section
\ref{sec:GroupIIMetals}).

\subsection{Group II metals}
\label{sec:GroupIIMetals}

Fatty acids neutralized by alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides form
\keyword{soaps}. If these metals are present in the feedstock, as catalyst, or
in washing water they can form soaps with the fatty acids in the biodiesel.
These soaps can form deposits in engines that can affect operations. For
example, deposits of calcium soaps have been reported to cause injectors to
stick \autocite{Pischinger2000}.

SANS 1935 prescribes EN 14538 as the method for determining Group II metals.
This is an optical emission spectroscopy method: a sample of the biodiesel is
diluted in kerosene, and injected into a inductively coupled argon plasma. The
emission intensities at certain wavelengths are compared to the emission
intensities of solvents containing known concentrations of the metals.

\subsection{Phosphorus}

Phosphorus expected in biodiesel should not affect a diesel engine's
performance, but it can have a detrimental effect on the exhaust treatment
system by forming ash that can clog filters and reactive species that can reduce
catalyst effectiveness. Trace levels of phosphorus will be expected in
biodiesel, in the form of natural phospholipids. Normal biodiesel feedstock and
production methods should yield acceptable phosphorus concentration, but
inorganic phosphorus might be present in biodiesel produced from used cooking
oil.
 
SANS 54107 is the prescribed method for determining phosphorus in biodiesel. A
sample of biodiesel is dissolved in xylene, and the solution introduced in
aerosol form into an inductively coupled argon plasma. The high temperature of
the plasma causes phosphorus atoms and/or ions to emit radiation. This emission
is measured at a certain wavelength, and compared to emissions from solutions
with known concentrations.

\subsection{Sulfur}

The amount of sulfur in biodiesel is limited not because it affects the fuel's
performance, but because the fuel must be compatible with emission control
systems and not be more polluting in terms of sulfur emissions than petrodiesel.
Most biodiesel feedstocks are naturally low in sulfur and are therefore unlikely
to exceed the limits.

There are two prescribed tests for sulfur. ISO 20846 is a UV fluorescence
method, while ISO 20884 is an X-ray fluorescence methods. The quantum-mechanical
mechanism is the same for both methods: a chemical species absorbs energy from a
photon which puts it in an activated state. The species then returns to a state
of lower energy, emitting a photon of different energy.
In the case of ISO 20846 the species is gaseous SO\textsubscript{2} (obtained by
combusting the sample), and the activating photons are from the ultraviolet part
of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the case of ISO 20884 the chemical species
are the bound form of the sulfur as found in the biodiesel, and the activating
photons are from the X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

\section{SANS 1935: Chemical properties: Chromatographic determination}
\label{sec:ChromDet}

\subsection{Methanol content}

Methanol in biodiesel increases its flash point, and it is an indicator of poor
production process control.

SANS 1935 requires a maximum mass fraction fo \SI{0.2}{\percent}. The prescribed
test method is contained in SANS 54110, and involves heating a sealed vial
partly filled with biodiesel to \SI{80}{\celsius}. A portion of the headspace
vapour is taken and injected into a gas chromatograph. The amount of methanol is
quantified by comparing the methanol peak to either an internal or external
standard.

\subsection{Ester content and Linolenic acid methyl ester content}
\label{sec:EsterContent}
As prescribed in Paragraph 3 of SANS 1935, biodiesel must consist of fatty acid
methyl esters. The first line of Table 1 quantifies this requirement as a
minimum of \SI{96.5}{\percent} mass fraction. 

The specified method is SANS 54103. This document refers to ISO 5508:1990, which
has been withdrawn and superseded by ISO 12966-4:2015. ISO 5508 and ISO 12966
describe gas chromatographic methods for the determination of FAMEs. ISO 5508 is
obsolete: it gives conditions for packed GC columns and thermal conductivity
detectors, two technologies which are now rarely found in the chromatography
laboratory. Both methods, however, require polar stationary phases. The quantity of
esters is determined by integrating all the peaks in a certain retention time
window and comparing it to the peak area of an internal standard.

\subsection{Glyceride content}
\label{sec:Glycerides}

Glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) is the ``backbone'' of the oil molecules that
constitute the feedstock for biodiesel production. Each hydroxyl group can form
an ester bond with a fatty acid, and when all three have a fatty acid bound to
it is an `oil molecule'. IUPAC recommends that such a molecule is called a
tri-O-acylglycerol \autocite{Nic2009}, but by long-established custom they are
called triglycerides. The conversion of a triglyceride to FAMEs is a stepwise
process, with one ester bond at a time being methanolized. This means that
during the reaction process, there will also be di- and monoglycerides (di- and
mono-O-acylglycerols) in the reaction mixture. If the reaction is not well
controlled then these glycerides will be found in the final product.

The presence of glycerides is of course an indicator of an incomplete
transesterification reaction, but it has further negative effects. In
particular, during cold weather, or in petroleum-blended biodiesel, some
dissolved impurities might precipitate, in particular the monoglycerides
\autocite{Dunn2009,Plata2015}. This precipitate might block filters or otherwise
interfere with engine performance.

SANS 1935 specifies that the mono-, di- and triglyceride content of biodiesel
must determined with a procedure compliant with SANS 54105 (or, equivalently, EN
14105). In this method, the biodiesel sample is treated with MSTFA
(2,2,2-Trifluoro-N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)acetamide) before injecting it into
a GC column.

MSTFA is a \keyword{derivatization reagent}: It reacts with the hydroxyl
hydrogen atoms in the glycerides to trimethylsilyl derivatives. The molecule is
then much more inert and will not interact with the column and the stationary
phase, yielding peaks with better shapes.

N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA). During GC the inert
trimethylsilyl group does not interact with the stationary phase or its support,
and the volatile trifluoroacetamide elutes with the solvent front.}

\label{fig:MSTFA}
\end{figure}

The trifluoroacetamide group is a good leaving group, and upon nucleophilic
attack by the hydroxyl oxygen its bond with the trimethylsilyl (TMS) group breaks,
leaving the TMS bound to the oxygen. The labile hydrogen atom is now replaced by
the TMS group, which is inert and will not interact with polar entities in the
stationary phase or column, which will lead to improved peak shapes. 

\subsection{Free Glycerol}

Free glycerol is one of the products of the transesterification of plant oils to
produce biodiesel. It is a polar compound, which naturally separates from
non-polar biodiesel, and any excess remaining dissolved in the biodiesel is
removed during the washing step. Free glycerol contributes to injector coking. 

Inappropriate processing may leave excess free glycerol in the biodiesel, and
therefore determining free glycerol is an important quality-control step.

Free glycerol can be determined by the same chromatographic procedure prescribed
for the determination of the other glycerides in SANS 54105 (see Section
\ref{sec:Glycerides}, but SANS 1935 also offers the option of SANS 54016. This
standard uses a liquid-liquid extraction of biodiesel with a mixture of ethanol,
water, and hexane. The free glycerol transfers quantitatively to the bottom
layer, which is then analysed with a gas chromatographic method. The benefit of
this method is that chromatogram is very simple: the glycerol is the only
analyte peak in the chromatogram, which greatly simplifies quantification.

The column specified in SANS 54106 method is a PLOT column, \textit{i.e.} a
Porous Layer Open Tubular column, which is a capillary lined on the inside with
a layer of particles coated with the stationary phase, in this case a polar
polyethylene glycol. 

\subsection{Polyunsaturated methyl esters}
\label{sec:ChromDetUnsat}

The degree of unsaturation of the constituent fatty acids are the main
determinant of the oxidative stability of biodiesel. SANS 1935 limits the amount
of highly unsaturated FAMEs by two lines in Table 1. In particular, the amount
of methyl linoleate is limited to less than \SI{12}{\percent} mass fraction, and
the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters with four or more double
bonds are limited to less than \SI{1}{\percent} mass fraction.

\subsubsection{Linolenic acid methyl ester}

The prescribed method for the determination of methyl linoleate (C18:3) is SANS
54103, the same method as prescribed for total esters (see Section
\ref{sec:EsterContent}).

\subsubsection{Highly unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters}

Polyunsatured fatty acids (PUFAs) with more than four double bonds are not
commonly found in plant oils, but are found in algae. Fish that feed on algae
accumulate these oils, so that they are also found in fish oils, but fish oils
are not a sustainable resource and should not be used for
fuel\autocite{Kitessa2014}. These compounds are highly oxidatively unstable, and
are therefore undesirable in biodiesel.

The method prescribed for the determination of PUFA FAMEs is EN 15779. This
method uses a capillary column with a wax stationary phase.

\subsection{Conclusion: room for innovation.}

The diversity of chromatographic biodiesel quality control methods causes the
compliance with SANS 1935 to be expensive. To comply, a biodiesel producer will
have to submit samples of biodiesel to at least four different kinds of
chromatographic analysis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item EN 14105 for free and total glycerol
  \item EN 14103 for FAME and methyl linoleate content
  \item EN 14110 for residual methanol 
  \item EN 15779 for highly unsaturated FAMEs
  \item (Optionally) EN 14106 for free glycerol
\end{itemize}

This might prove costly, and there has been at least one innovation to reduce
the number of instruments required \autocite{McCurry2009}.

As was emphasized in the introduction to this chapter (see Section
\ref{Sec:Intro}), standards are not `the best' way of determining a certain
desirable property of biodiesel, it is merely a trusted method. As improved
methods are developed and become trustworthy, they can be adopted as
alternatives. As far as biodiesel is concerned, it seems that there is ample
room for chromatographers to innovate and develop improved methods and
instrumentation.
