\section{Introduction}


Biodiesel consists mostly of a mixture of methyl esters of fatty acids obtained
from plant oils. To comply with the relevant technical standard, SANS 1935,
\autocite{SANS1935} (see Chapter \ref{Chapter3}), it must consist of a mass
fraction of \SI{96.5}{\percent} or more of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME), but
not more than \SI{12}{\percent} linolenic acid methyl ester, and not more than
\SI{1}{\percent} of FAMEs with more than \num{4} double bonds. The prescribed
methods for determining the quantities of these compounds are chromatographic,
but the method for  determining the \emph{total amount} of FAMEs differs
completely from the method for determining the amount of \emph{unsaturated}
FAMEs. Both these methods generate complex chromatograms that need highly
skilled and experienced chromatographers to interpret. There is no doubt that
the use of artificial intelligence and other technological innovations for
interpreting chromatograms will grow, but the paradox of
automation\footnote{Automation helps you least when you need it most
\autocite{Strauch2018, Bainbridge1983}.} predicts that as biodiesel production
grows, feedstocks proliferate, and complexity increase, the analytical chemist
will need better tools, methods, and instruments to understand the problems that
arise when automation fails. Comprehensively coupled chromatography offers a way
to better exploit chemistry for improved analytical separations, adding another
tool to the chemical analyst's toolbox. It does this in three ways: the first is
by increasing the peak capacity of the system, the second is by improved
sensitivity, and the third is by generating patterns in the data.

\section{SFC of FAMEs}

The power of comprehensive chromatography is unlocked by orthogonality.
Orthogonality is the difference in separation mechanism between the two
dimensions \autocite{Marriott2012}. When FAMES are chromatographically separated
by SFC in using neat carbon dioxide as a mobile phase and unmodified silica as a
stationary phase, the separation is according to the number of double bonds,
independent of chain length \autocite{Robertson1991, Smith1994, Smith2001}. This
stands in strong contrast to the separation of FAMEs by GC, where the major
separation is according to volatility, which can be adjusted --- but not
overridden --- by changing the polarity (or other chemical aspect) of the
stationary phase (See Figure \ref{fig:RestekFAMEsGC}).

\caption[Separation of FAME by GC]{This figure shows that when separating FAMEs
by GC, using specialized column, separation is primarily by fatty acid chain
length, and secondarily by number of double bonds. Reproduced with permission of Restek Corporation.}

\label{fig:RestekFAMEsGC}
\end{figure}

Silver ions are often used in stationary phases to separate unsaturated
compounds, and this includes stationary phases for SFC \autocite{Sandra2002,
Potgieter2013}. The retention mechanism is quite complex
\autocite{Nikolova-Damyanova2019}, but it offers a powerful technique for the
elucidation of lipid structures, as reviewed as early as 1966
\autocite{Morris1966}. Nevertheless, in this chapter the use of stationary
phases modified with silver ions was neither necessary nor attempted.

%As discussed in Section \ref{sec:Rancimat}, fatty acids are not stable at high
%temperatures. This means that they might degrade during chromatographic
%separation at high temperature, especially if the run times are long. Because
%SFC operates at low temperatures, the unstable compounds are less likely to
%degrade.

The utterly different retention behaviours of FAMEs on silica with a carbon
dioxide mobile phase and on GC offers high orthogonality, which promises to make
comprehensive coupling worthwhile.

\section[Coaxial heater performance.]{Performance of the coaxial heater.}

Practical SFC×GC depends on reliably repeating fast temperature programs on a
capillary gas chromatography column. The effect of these conditions on the
column will be discussed in the following sections.

\subsection{Column lifetime}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:ChromDet}, FAMEs can be separated by gas
chromatography using relatively non-polar columns with high-temperature
programs. For this purpose column manufacturers supply special 'high
temperature' columns, which address two aspects of column lifetime: mechanical
degradation and stationary phase degradation. The SFC×GC chromatograph did not
use such columns, and the following discussion explains why their use could be
avoided.

\subsubsection{Mechanical degradation}
Fused silica has a high \keyword{tensile strength}, but also a low
\keyword{fracture toughness}. This means that it is strong enough to resist the
forces involved in its use as a column, but very liable to fracture if it gets
damaged. Very small flaws, less than a micron in depth, will cause fused silica
(or any other glass) to fracture under loads far under what would be expected
from its tensile strength. Such flaws can be caused by mechanical scratches or
reaction with atmospheric water. To prevent this the outside of the fused silica
capillary is coated with a protective layer of \keyword{polyimide resin}. The
strength of the a capillary column therefore depends on the integrity of the
polyimide coating. Like all resins and polymers, the polyimide coating degrades
faster at higher temperatures, so the longer the column spends at high
temperature the sooner the polyimide will degrade to the point where it fails to
protect the fused silica, and the shorter the overall mechanical lifetime of the
column will be.

Traditionally, chromatographers are advised to use temperature programs that
minimize the time spent at high temperature, which will contribute to longer
column lifetimes. The usual way to do it is to use a temperature program with
a maximum temperature no higher than necessary, but the same cumulative time at
high temperature can be obtained by using higher temperatures but for shorter
periods. Fast temperature programs expose the columns to high temperatures for
only very brief periods.

(Column mechanical lifetime can also be improved by using metal capillaries.
Metals are not afflicted by brittle fracture the way fused silica is, but they
don't offer the chemical inertness of fused silica. To exploit the fracture
toughness of metal, technologies have been developed to deactivate metal surfaces
\autocite{Rohwer1986, Smith2002}, which makes metal columns a modern
possibility. Column manufacturers offer metal columns specifically designed for
biodiesel analysis.)

Another durability benefit of the stainless steel coaxial heater is that the
outer surface of the capillary column is protected from mechanical damage by its
encasement in the stainless steel tube of the coaxial heater. During development
of the coaxial heater there were occasions where the column was accidentally
overheated by poorly-controlled resistive heating. Even though the polyimide
coating had been completely charred away and the capillary was left fragile, the
column was intact and still provided separations.

Using carbon dioxide as a between-program coolant also protects the polyimide
coating from oxidative damage by purging the column environment of oxygen.

\subsubsection{Stationary phase degradation}

The stationary phases inside the GC columns face degradation similar to that of
the polyimide. Column manufacturers minimize sta\-tion\-ary phase degradation by
using improved technologies like cross-linked resins, or polymers with backbones
resistant to certain degradation mechanisms \autocite{Day2003}.
Fast temperature programs help extend stationary phase lifetime by minimizing
the cumulative time the column spends at high temperature.

\subsubsection{Column bleed}
Short columns and fast temperature programs have another beneficial side effect:
reduced \keyword{column bleed}. Any resin- or polymer-based stationary phase
degrades over time, and this degradation is faster at higher temperatures
\autocite[p. 66]{Mcnair2019}. It is observed as a rise in baseline during the
high temperature part of a temperature program. Various stationary phase
technologies can be employed to reduce column bleed, but because the amount of
column bleed depends on the amount of stationary phase it is clear that a
\SI{1}{\metre} column will have \num{1/30}th of the column bleed of a
\SI{30}{\metre} column with the same stationary phase. Despite using temperature
programs that went up to the temperature limit recommended by the column
manufacturer, column bleed was not a significant feature in the obtained
chromatograms.

\subsection{Thermal shock}
An aspect of fast temperature programming with such a temperature range as used
in this study (\SIrange{-30}{400}{\celsius}) is \keyword{thermal shock}. Thermal
shock occurs when an object is subjected to a rapid change in temperature. Under
such non-equilibrium conditions different parts of the object will have
different temperatures. The material that the object is made of has a certain
\keyword{coefficient of thermal expansion}, which means that the relative sizes
of the parts of the object at different temperatures will change at different
rates. This will cause stress between the parts, and if the stress exceeds the
strength of the material, the material will fracture. Fused silica has a low
coefficient of expansion\footnote{ (\SI{0.55e-6}{\per\kelvin}, compared to the
\SI{9.0e-6}{\per\kelvin} of soda lime glass or the \SI{4.0e-6}{\per\kelvin} of
borosilicate glass}, and therefore experiences low thermal shock. The amount of
material in a capillary is also relatively small, which keeps temperature
gradients small and therefore stresses low. We didn't observe any column
failures that could be ascribed to thermal shock.

\subsection{Thermal fatigue}

Another cause of material failure due to temperature is \keyword{thermal
fatigue}. ``Thermal fatigue (TF) is the gradual deterioration and eventual
cracking of a material by alternate heating and cooling during which free
thermal expansion is partially or completely constrained'' \autocite{Rao2001}.
The expansion of the portion of the fused silica column subjected to alternate
heating and cooling is not constrained, and the part of the fused silica column
that is constrained (in the sealing ferrules) is not subjected to alternate
heating and cooling (it is held at constant temperature in the heated T-piece
block), therefore we do not expect thermal fatigue. We did not explicitly test
for the occurrence of thermal fatigue, but we did not encounter column failure
that could be attributed to thermal fatigue.

\subsection{Corrosion}
One failure of the coaxial heater could be attributed to corrosion. The joint
between the coaxial heater and the heated T-piece block is brazed, and there was
a failure of the thin-walled stainless steel tube near that joint in the portion
heated during the brazing operation. Visual inspection seemed to indicate
thinning caused by corrosion. An acid flux was used during the brazing, which
might have contributed to the corrosion, especially in the presence of water
condensed from the atmosphere during the cooling of the column.

\subsection{GC retention time precision}

During the development of the resistive heater it was shown that the measured
temperature ramps are highly repeatable. But the retention times of  compounds
being separated by GC are highly sensitive to temperature, so it was necessary
to obtain a measure of the retention time repeatability.

To estimate the retention time variance, two alkanes (dodecane and hexadecane)
were added to the SFC mobile phase at low concentration. These compounds are not
retained on the silica at all, and are therefore present in all the GC runs at
the same concentration and all the peaks should be identical. Variance in
retention time, peak area, and peak height therefore indicate the repeatability
of the fast GC system. Variability of retention time is summarized in Table
\ref{tab:RetentionTimeVariance}.

\begin{table}

	\caption{\label{tab:RetentionTimeVariance}A summary of retention time repeatability of alkanes
separated on the fast temperature programmed chromatograph.}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lllll}
	\toprule
	\tabhead{Compound} & \tabhead{n} & \tabhead{t\textsubscript{r} (s)} & \tabhead{S.D. of t\textsubscript{r} (s)}	& \tabhead{R.S.D. of t\textsubscript{r} (\%)} \\
	\midrule
	Dodecane 			& 73 		& 5.07 								& 0.023 									& 0.46\\
	Hexadecane			& 73 		& 6.58 								& 0.052 									& 0.78\\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The peak widths were about \SI{500}{\milli\second}, so the
\SI{20}{\milli\second} standard deviation for hexadecane means that the
variation in retention time is only about \SI{10}{\percent} of the peak width.
The relative standard deviations (RSD) of retention times were similar to those
obtained in GC×GC \autocite{Shellie2002}, and much smaller than those of our
original ``proof of concept'' instrument \autocite{Venter2003, Venter2004}.

\section[Study of biodiesel by SFC×GC]{Study of potential biodiesel feedstock by SFC×GC}

Biodiesel can be produced from any combination of a variety of vegetable
oils\footnote{At this time SANS 1935 excludes animal fats, but they might be
included in future. All of the following discussion also applies to animal
fats.}. Indeed, to ensure conformance to standards it might be necessary to
produce biodiesel from blends or combinations of oils. But as an introduction it
is instructive to start by analysing the FAMEs obtained from neat oils.

\subsection{Samples}

Various samples of edible vegetable oil were obtained from
supermarkets. (See Table \ref{tab:OilSamples})

\begin{table}
	\caption{Oils used for FAME analysis}
	\label{tab:OilSamples}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l l l}
	\toprule
	\tabhead{Oil} & \tabhead{Brand} & \tabhead{Species} 			\\
	\midrule
	Canola			& Spar			& \textit{Brassica napus}		\\
	Sunflower oil	& Pick n Pay 	& \textit{Helianthus annuus}	\\

%	Olive oil 		& Hojiblanca	& \textit{Olea europaea}		\\
	\bottomrule\\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sample preparation}

Fatty acids in oils might be either free or bound to glycerol. To quantitatively
convert them to FAME therefore requires that the bound fatty acid be transesterified,
and the free fatty acids esterified. Both transesterification and esterification
can be achieved by acid catalyst, but this reaction is quite slow. Basic
catalysts can rapidly transesterify acyl glycerols, but will not esterify free
fatty acids.

The method used involved first treating the oil sample with sodium hydroxide
dissolved in dry methanol. The methanol acts as a solvent but also provides an
excess of methanol so that the transesterification reaction is driven to
completion. On completion of the reaction an excess of acid is added, which
neutralizes the base and esterifies any free fatty acids. Then an organic
solvent and water are added, which provides two phases: the non-polar FAMEs
dissolve in the organic layer, and the polar glycerol and salts dissolve in the
water layer.

\subsubsection{Method}

This method is based on an official method \autocite{AOCS2017}, modified in two
respects. Firstly, the acidic catalyst boron trifluoride is replaced by
sulphuric acid, and secondly, hexane is used instead of heptane.

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Transfer \num{4} drops of melted sample to a \SI{20}{\milli\litre} glass
stoppered test tube. Add a few boiling stones.

\item Add \SI{2}{\milli\litre} NaOH/methanol solution (0.5N) and boil for
\SI{11}{\min} under reflux.

\item Add \SI{2}{\milli\litre} 10\%
H\textsubscript{2}SO\textsubscript{4}/methanol solution via the condenser and
boil for \SI{2}{\minute}.

\item  Add \SI{2}{\milli\litre} hexane via the condenser and boil for
\SI{1}{\minute}.

\item Remove the test tube from the heat source and leave to cool.

\item Add \SI{4}{\milli\litre} saturated NaCl solution and mix gently.

\item Allow the phases to separate. Transfer the hexane layer to a vial and use
for injection.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{SFC}

A \SI{0.5}{\micro\litre} volume of the hexane layer was injected into the neat
carbon dioxide mobile phase as described in Section \ref{sec:SFCInjection}. The
column was five HPLC columns (150 mm $\times$ 4.6 mm, 3 $\mu$m particles)
(Restek, Pinnacle DB Silica) connected in series.

\subsection{Modulation}

The modulation period was \SI{10}{\second}, during which the fractions of the SFC
eluate were transferred to the GC inlet via a linear restrictor. In the hot
(\SI{350}{\celsius}) inlet the fractions evaporated instantly and were swept onto the
cold (\SI{-20}{\celsius}) column where they were trapped in the stationary phase.
\SI{3}{\second} after the collection period ended the vent valve opened for
\SI{1}{\second} to vent excess pressure from the GC inlet.

\subsection{GC}

The fast temperature program ramped the GC column temperature from
\SI{-20}{\celsius} to \SI{350}{\celsius} in \SI{10}{s}
(\SI{2200}{\celsius\per\second}), maintaining \SI{350}{\celsius} for
\SI{2}{\second}. Then the cooling system activated and cooled the column to
\SI{-20}{\celsius} or below, ready to trap the next SFC fraction. The FID
detector was kept at \SI{350}{\celsius}.

In this way a series of GC chromatograms of SFC fractions were recorded, which
were assembled into a 2D chromatogram. Figure \ref{fig:2DCanola} shows
a 2D chromatogram of a sample of FAME prepared from canola oil. This 2D
chromatogram consists of 132 fast GC chromatograms collected in approximately 90
minutes.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/Interpretation.png}

\caption[SFC×GC of canola oil]{A 2D chromatogram of FAMEs derived from
canola oil. It is clear that the oil consists mostly of unsaturated fatty
acids.}

\label{fig:2DCanola}
\end{figure}

The chromatogram shown in Figure \ref{fig:2DCanola} is very simple to interpret.
In the SFC dimension, separation is by number of double bonds.
This means that FAMEs without double bonds elute first in this dimension,
followed by FAMEs with one, two and three double bonds respectively. There is
good resolution between the peaks in the SFC dimension.

The volatility of a FAME depends primarily on the length of the carbon atom
chain, therefore the separation in the GC dimension is by chain length. Because
these FAMEs are of biological origin, we expect their chains to have an even
number of carbon atoms. From the literature we know that oleic acid (C18:1) is
the most common fatty acid in canola oil \autocite{JFAOWHOCAC2019}, and that
therefore the major peak in the chromatogram is a C18 FAME. This allows us to
easily identify the peaks for C16, C18, C20, and C22 in the GC dimension.

The information provided by this chromatogram confirms that canola oil is a
vi\-able bio\-diesel feedstock: The unsaturated compounds have mostly a single
double bond, which should make it oxidatively stable, and the quantities of
unsaturated FAMEs are low, which means that it will most likely have suitable
cold-flow properties, because (cis) unsaturated FAMEs have higher freezing
points than saturated FAMEs.

\caption[SFC×GC of sunflower oil]{A 2D chromatogram of FAMEs derived from
sunflower oil. It is clear that the oil consists mostly of unsaturated fatty
acids, with a high proportion of linoleic acid (C18:2)}

\label{fig:2DSunflower}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sunflower oil}

Figure \ref{fig:2DSunflower} shows an SFC×GC chromatogram of FAMEs obtained from
sunflower oil. The biggest peak in the chromatogram corresponds to linoleic acid
methyl ester (C18:2). This agrees with the literature, which indicates that the
main, traditional cultivar of sunflower produced in South Africa is of the
high-linoleic type, with a fatty acid profile of \SI{69}{\percent} linoleic
acid, \SI{20}{\percent} oleic acid, and \SI{11}{\percent} saturated fats
\autocite {JFAOWHOCAC2019}.

This sunflower oil chromatogram was compared to a fatty acid profile obtained by
an accredited oil analysis laboratory\footnote{Precision Oil Laboratories,
info@precisionoils.co.za,  +27 15 307 7208, SANAS Testing Laboratory T0802}.
(See Table \ref{tab:SunflowerPrecisionOils}.) The fatty acid profile data was
plotted on a 3D bar chart (See Figure \ref{fig:2DSunflowerBarChart}). The axes
of the bar chart were chosen to plot the fatty acid profile information in a
similar space and scale as the chromatogram (Figure \ref{fig:2DSunflower}). It
can be seen that the bar chart shows the same information as the chromatogram.
The information in the bar chart has been obtained from a 1D chromatogram by
integrating peaks, calculating amounts of FAMEs from peak areas, and then
plotting those amounts in the bar chart, whereas the SFC×GC chromatogram is a
plot of FID response and involves no quantification.

This chromatogram suggests that sunflower oil is a suitable feedstock for
producing biodiesel: the relatively high amount of unsaturated FAs would seem to
imply suitable cold flow properties. The relatively high degree of unsaturation
does suggest caution regarding oxidative stability.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Coconut oil}

Figure \ref{fig:2DCoconut} shows the SFC×GC chromatogram of FAMES from coconut
oil (\textit{Cocos nucifera L}). It is clear that the dominant FAMEs in coconut
oil are saturated.

The high saturation of coconut oil makes it oxidatively stable, but the high
melting point of the saturated FAMEs also means that it might not meet
cold flow requirements.

The high oxidative stability of coconut oil makes it resistant to going rancid,
which means it has been used as a natural ingredient for cosmetics since
antiquity \autocite{Berdick1972}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Flax seed oil}

Figure \ref{fig:2DFlax} shows an SFC×GC chromatogram of FAMEs obtained from flax
seed oil. This oil is obtained from the seeds of the annual plant \textit{Linum
usitatissimum}, and was sold as an edible oil.

\begin{figure}

\caption[SFC×GC of flax seed oil]{A 2D chromatogram of FAMEs derived from
flax seed oil. It is clear that the oil consists mostly of highly unsaturated fatty
acids.}

\label{fig:2DFlax}
\end{figure}

The chromatogram shows that the major fatty acid component of flax seed oil is
linolenic acid (C18:3). This will immediately inform a producer that flax seed
oil would not be a suitable feedstock for biodiesel: SANS 1935 limits the
linolenic acid fraction to less than \SI{12}{\percent} (See section
\ref{sec:ChromDetUnsat}).

Flax seed oil only recently became considered a food or a food supplement: the
1911 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica only mentions it as a food by
saying ``The oil is to some extent used as food in Russia and in parts of Poland
and Hungary" \autocite{Linseed1911}, and remarks that the oil is edible when it
is cold pressed. This is not surprising, because the oil goes rancid very
quickly, leaving it unpalatable. Historically the more common name for the oil
has been \keyword{linseed oil} and it was mainly used for industrial purposes,
particularly in paint and varnish formulations. As the encyclopedia puts it:
``Commercial linseed oil has a peculiar, rather disagreeable sharp taste and
smell.'' The oil used in artists' oil paints is most commonly refined and
prepared linseed oil. This oil is classed as a \keyword{drying oil}, because a
layer of this oil exposed to air becomes solid, or ``dry". This is the result of
the high degree of unsaturation of the oil, which rapidly causes oxygen-mediated
polymerization. On exposure to air the oil gradually turns more viscous and
eventually solid, making it a suitable base for paint, particularly if the oil
has been pre-treated. In biodiesel such polymerization could cause clogging or
the formation of objectionable sludge.

\section{The study of biodiesel blends by SFC×GC}

\subsection{Introduction}
Biodiesel can be blended in all proportions with diesel obtained from petroleum
(\keyword{petrodiesel}). The volatility of biodiesel is slightly lower than that
of petrodiesel, but in 1D gas chromatography the peaks of biodiesel compounds
with higher volatility overlap significantly with the peaks of petrodiesel
compounds of lower volatility. The high complexity of the petrodiesel therefore
interferes with the determination of the biodiesel compounds. One example of an
attempt to overcome this problem is the use of a highly polar ionic liquid
column, which increases the retention of the FAMEs in the blend relative to the
retention of the petrodiesel hydrocarbons \autocite{Ragonese2009}.

On a polar stationary phase like bare silica with a non-polar mobile phase
like carbon dioxide, the hydrocarbons from petrodiesel are not expected to be
significantly retained. But, as shown in the in the previous section, under such
conditions FAMEs are retained and separated. When we inject a blend of biodiesel
and petrodiesel on SFC×GC, we therefore expect the biodiesel portion to be
completely separated from the petrodiesel portion.

\subsection{Sample}

A B50 biodiesel blend was prepared by mixing equal volumes of biodiesel and
petrodiesel in the laboratory. The biodiesel sample was donated by a commercial
testing laboratory and had been produced from waste cooking oil by an anonymous
producer. The petrodiesel sample (Shell Extra Diesel 500 ppm) was obtained from
a consumer filling station. The injection system described in Section
\ref{sec:SFCInjection} was used to inject a \SI{0.5}{\micro\litre} volume of
this undiluted B50 blend.

\subsection{SFC}

The SFC used neat carbon dioxide at \SI{200}{\bar} inlet pressure as mobile
phase. The column consisted of five HPLC bare silica columns
(\SI{150}{\milli\metre} $\times$ \SI{4.6}{\milli\metre}, 3 $\mu$m particles)
(Restek, Pinnacle DB Silica) connected in series.

\subsection{Modulation}

The SFC eluate fractions of \SI{2}{\second} were collected on the GC column
cooled to a temperature of \SI{-20}{\celsius}. The inlet vent was held closed
for \SI{4}{\second}, and then opened for \SI{1}{\second} to release excess
pressure.

\subsection{GC}

The column used in the fast gas chromatograph was an OV-5 column, which has a
stationary phase comprised of \SI{5}{\percent} diphenyl, \SI{95}{\percent}
dimethylpolysiloxane. It was \SI{1}{\metre} long, with an internal diameter of
\SI{0.25}{\milli\metre}. The thickness of the stationary phase was
\SI{0.25}{\micro\metre}.

The temperature was ramped from \SI{-20}{\celsius} at a rate of
\SI{1800}{\celsius\per\minute} to \SI{250}{\celsius}, where it was maintained
for \SI{6}{s}. After the temperature program had ended the column was cooled to
\SI{-20}{\celsius} again and the next fraction was collected.

The detector was an FID at \SI{250}{\celsius}. The FID response was recorded,
and so a total of 371 fast GC chromatograms were collected to compile the 2D
chromatogram.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

\end{figure}

The chromatogram of the biodiesel/petrodiesel blend (Figure \ref{fig:B50}) shows
that the blend was separated into two distinct groups of compounds. At a \oneD
(SFC) retention time of about \SI{160}{\second} the hydrocarbons from the
petrodiesel part of the blend elutes. To those familiar with petrochemical
chromatography the characteristic unresolved complex mixture (``hydrocarbon
hump'') topped by alkane peaks will be instantly recognizable as representing
a petroleum product. (See Figure \ref{fig:HCHump} for an example.)

chromatogram obtained from a petroleum-based diesel fuel sample, showing the

	\label{fig:HCHump} 
\end{figure}

Between the \textsuperscript{1}D retention times of \SI{300}{\second} and
\SI{480}{\second} the peaks of the FAMEs are seen, clearly separated by number
of double bonds in the SFC dimension, and by volatility in the GC dimension.
When compared to Figure \ref{fig:2DSunflower}, one can surmise that the
feedstock for the biodiesel was waste sunflower oil.

It is worth pointing out that the hydrocarbons from the petrodiesel fraction of
the blend were also separated on the SFC dimension \autocite{Venter1999a}. This
is not surprising: the standard ASTM D 5186 provides a method for the
determination of aromatic compounds in diesel by SFC \autocite{ASTMD5186}. The
application of this method separates the unretained non-aromatics from the
monoaromatics and from the polynuclear aromatics. The SFC×GC method provides
additional information about the volatility of those aromatics which could help
to quantify or identify them, but that falls outside the scope of this
discussion.

This separation shows that SFC×GC can be used to investigate the biodiesel
component of petrodiesel/biodiesel blends without sample pre-treatment or
specialized columns. The intrinsic orthogonality provides easy identification of
components and the excess separation space allows for the addition of suitable
internal standards for reliable qualitative and quantitative analysis with the
robust FID with its predictable response. Expensive
mass spectrometric detection is unnecessary

Being able to determine the biodiesel content of biodiesel blends may prove
useful in at least two scenarios: 

The first is in monitoring blending. Biodiesel, essentially a mixture of esters,
is quite polar compared to petrodiesel, essentially a mixture of hydrocarbons.
This means that blending might not be a matter of just pumping the relevant volumes
of the respective fuels into a tank and relying on diffusion to complete the
mixing. Being able to determine the amount of biodiesel in different samples of
a blend will provide assurance that the blend is homogenous and should perform
according to expectations. While such a test is perhaps better performed using a
spectroscopic method, SFC×GC can provide information for calibration, and will
of course be invaluable during trouble shooting.

The second application of SFC×GC is in regulating biodiesel content. In some
political environments fuels might be taxed according to their
biologically-derived content, for example to promote agriculture or to meet
carbon emissions targets. Sometimes biological content is not encouraged by
taxation, but simply mandated. Such incentives and mandates are of course liable
to corruption, and therefore the ability to monitor the blending of the fuels is
needed. The most reliable way to differentiate between organic matter derived
from biological sources and organic matter derived from fossil sources is a
radiochemical method, where the content of radioactive \textsuperscript{14}C is
determined. (Organic material from fossil sources contains no
\textsuperscript{14}C.) The technical standard ASTM D6866 provides an approved
method. But radiochemical methods require specialized equipment and trained
staff, whereas fuel laboratories more often have experience with chromatographic
techniques and might find SFC×GC a useful technique to provide evidence that a
diesel fuel blend contains the stated amount of biodiesel.

\section{Conclusion}

Comprehensively coupled chromatography offers better analytical separations in
three ways: improved peak capacity, improved sensitivity, and more structured
data. The examples presented here do not pretend to prove improved peak
capacity: biodiesel is not normally considered a chromatographically-challenging
complex sample. Neither is improved sensitivity relevant: determining biodiesel
components is not a trace analysis problem for which high sensitivity is
necessary. What these examples do show is that the high orthogonality between
SFC and GC provides data that contains a clear and powerful pattern that greatly
simplifies interpretation.

In the example of FAMEs derived from various vegetable oils the pattern shows
how the degree of unsaturation provides separation on the first dimension, and
the volatility provides separation on the second dimension. These separations,
combined in one 2D chromatogram, provides intuitive understanding of the
chemical composition of the oils which facilitates prediction about the
contribution these oils will make to the final biodiesel product.

In the example of examining the FAME content of a biodiesel blend, the pattern
shows that SFC readily separates the petroleum-derived hydrocarbons from the
FAMEs of biological origin. The biodiesel content can be determined by focusing
data analysis efforts on the relevant parts of the chromatogram.

SFC×GC can assist with proving compliance: it provides a chromatographic method that
combines the determination of total FAMEs and unsaturated FAMEs in a single
method, and might provide a way to quantify the biodiesel component in blends
with petrodiesel, and cost-effective, accurate and reliable quantitation of the
biodiesel component in blends with petrodiesel can be expected.

The provided examples also prove that it is possible to design a system that
solves the problems of doing practical, rapidly-repeated fast temperature
programmed GC, ramping temperatures from below ambient to the limits of the
column in hundreds of consecutive, identical runs. This high performance is
possible without resorting to advanced or expensive technology.
