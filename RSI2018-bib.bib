programmed gas chromatography, under different optimization constraints
are identified. Applying these criteria to experimental data, it is shown that when
column pressure drop is high, the optimum heating rate for n-alkanes and
pesticides in a column with a silicone stationary phase of a typical thickness is
about 10 C° per void time. This heating rate is recommended as a default for all
temperature programs in capillary GC.},

The SFC was operated isothermally with stopped flow to provide a sufficient time span for the GC analysis. The GC analysis had a typical cycle time of 1 min for the system demonstrated here. During this time, the GC column was independently heated at a rate of 450 degrees C/min to 250 degrees C and actively cooled again to -50 degrees C before the next GC injection took place.

The transfer line module has two heated tubes (transfer lines) through which the column leads pass from the LTM column module into the oven. These transfer lines are temperature programmable to prevent cold spots in the sample path between the GC oven and the LTM column assembly. Each LTM column module attaches to a transfer line module, and the resulting module assembly inserts into slots in the LTM oven door.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although pilot studies have reported that exhaled propofol concentrations can reflect intraoperative plasma propofol concentrations in an individual, the blood/exhaled partial pressure ratio RBE varies between patients, and the relevant factors have not yet been clearly addressed. No efficient method has been reported for the quick evaluation of RBE and its association with inter-individual variables. METHODS: We proposed a novel method that uses a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor combined with a fast gas chromatograph (GC) to simultaneously detect propofol concentrations in blood and exhaled gas in 28 patients who were receiving propofol i.v. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model was established to simulate propofol concentrations in exhaled gas and blood after a bolus injection. Simulated propofol concentrations for exhaled gas and blood were used in a linear regression model to evaluate RBE. RESULTS: The fast GC-SAW system showed reliability and efficiency for simultaneous quantitative determination of propofol in blood (correlation coefficient R(2)=0.994, P{\textless}0.01) and exhaled gas (R(2)=0.991, P{\textless}0.01). The evaluation of RBE takes {\textless}50 min for a patient. The distribution of RBE in 28 patients showed inter-individual differences in RBE (median 1.27; inter-quartile range 1.07-1.59). CONCLUSIONS: Fast GC-SAW, which analyses samples in seconds, can perform both rapid monitoring of exhaled propofol concentrations and fast analysis of blood propofol concentrations. The proposed method allows early determination of the coefficient RBE in individuals. Further studies are required to quantify the distribution of RBE in a larger cohort and assess the effect of other potential factors. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR-ONC-13003291.},

This study proposed a non-invasive method utilizing a fast gas chromatograph combined with a surface acoustic wave sensor (Fast GC-SAW) to simultaneously on-line monitor sevoflurane and propofol in patients' exhaled gas. By using the direct resistive heating capillary column, the single detection time of Fast GC-SAW system was significantly shortened to 90s, as well as the size reduced to (40cm × 30cm × 20 cm). Besides, in the calibration of sevoflurane, Fast GC-SAW system showed a good linear correlation (R2 = 0.9925, P {\textless} 0.01) with gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC–MS), which ensured the reliability and accuracy of the Fast GC-SAW system. Finally, clinical experiments on patients under balanced anesthesia were conducted. The varied concentrations measured by Fast GC-SAW extraordinarily matched the clinical usages of these two anesthetics.},

The volatile organic compounds (VOC) of the meat samples with 1, 4, and 7 days of chill storage and samples with 5 months of frozen storage were investigated. Principal components analysis (PCA) showed differences in the volatile organic compounds profiles. Discriminant factor analysis (DFA) model was developed to identify the freshness of the meat samples. Results showed that using E-nose Heracles II allowed effective recognition of chilled and frozen pork meats. Significant differences were found between VOC profiles. In practice, this technique could be applied to the meat industry for a rapid, cheap, and reliable assessment of meat freshness. Practical applications Investigation of methods for differentiation of chill-stored and frozen pork necks is of significance for quality and safety maintenance.

Heating and cooling properties of the apparatus are evaluated and examples are given illustrating the advantages of greatly reducing the air bath volume surrounding fused silica columns. Fast heating and cooling of the oven permit it to be employed for repetitive injection analyses. By using fast gas chromatography separations to achieve short assay cycle times, the apparatus can be employed for on-line species-specific gas stream composition monitoring when volatile species concentrations vary on time scales of a few minutes or longer. This capability facilitates repeated sampling and fast gas chromatographic separations of volatile product mixtures produced during thermal analyses. Applications of repetitive injection gas chromatography-mass spectrometry evolved gas analyses to monitoring purge gas effluent streams containing volatile acid catalyzed polymer cracking products are described.

Important aspects to consider when developing automated LG x GC include the relative speeds of the two dimensions, the compatibility of the LC eluent (type and flow rate) with the GC dimension, and the column loadabilities. Because the GC separation is relatively slow, the LC instrument has to be operated in the stop-flow mode. Two interfaces for transferring large numbers of subsequent LC fractions to the GC were constructed: one based on a six-port switching valve, and one which uses a dual side-port syringe. Both interfaces were found to perform fully acceptably. The actual transfer of the LC fraction to the GC was realised using a standard split injector to vaporise the compounds and LC eluent. Gas phase splitting was applied to match LC mass load and GC column loadability. The standard deviations of the peak areas obtained in this way were better than 7% (n = 6). The reliability of the system was demonstrated by the problem-free analysis of large series of oil and fat samples, with the focus on both intact triglycerides and their fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). Finally, the hyphenation of the automated LC x GC system to a sensitive and rapid-scanning time-of-flight mass spectrometer was realised. By using LC x GC-ToF MS, the information density of the chromatograms could be improved even further, which allowed easy identification of individual compounds as well as compound groups.},

Today, revived interest in fast GC is seen to be driven by applications, such as process control and high-throughput analysis, or by the desire to reduce the costs of operation and ownership in routine analysis. Numerous options exist for speeding up GC separations. Which option to select depends strongly on the application under study. The first step should always be to see if it is possible to trade resolution for time. If this approach fails, the concept of “resolution-normalised conditions” comes into play. An overview of options for faster chromatography and a system for classifying chromatograms are brought together to give guidelines for speeding up specific applications. The practical consequences of implementing these options are discussed and the instrumental requirements are outlined. Applications of the various methods for faster GC are given.},

  abstract  = {The features of a resistive-heated capillary column for fast temperature-programmed gas chromatography (GC) have been evaluated. Experiments were carried out using a commercial available EZ Flash GC, an assembly which can be used to upgrade existing gas chromatographs. The capillary column is placed inside a metal tube which can be heated, and cooled, much more rapidly than any conventional GC oven. The EZ Flash assembly can generate temperature ramps up to 1200°/min and can be cooled down from 300 to 50°C in 30 s. Samples were injected via a conventional split/splitless injector and transferred to the GC column. The combination of a short column (5 m×0.25 mm i. d.), a high gas flow rate (up to 10 mL/min), and fast temperature programmes typically decreased analysis times from 30 min to about 2.5 min. Both the split and splitless injection mode could be used. With n-alkanes as test analytes, the standard deviations of the retention times with respect to the peak width were less than 15% (n = 7). First results on RSDs of peak areas of less than 3% for all but one n-alkane indicate that the technique can also be used for quantification. The combined use of a short GC column and fast temperature gradients does cause some loss of separation efficiency, but the approach is ideally suited for fast screening as illustrated for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organophosphorus pesticides, and triazine herbicides as test compounds. Total analysis times – which included injection, separation, and equilibration to initial conditions – were typically less than 3 min.},

  abstract = {An overview is given of existing methods to minimise the analysis time in gas chromatography (GC) being the subject of many publications in the scientific literature. Packed and (multi-) capillary columns are compared with respect to their deployment in fast GC. It is assumed that the contribution of the stationary phase to peak broadening can be neglected (low liquid phase loading and thin film columns, respectively). The treatment is based on the minimisation of the analysis time required on both column types for the resolution of a critical pair of solutes (resolution normalised conditions). Theoretical relationships are given, describing analysis time and the related pressure drop. The equations are expressed in reduced parameters, making a comparison of column types considerably simpler than with the conventional equations. Reduction of the characteristic diameter, being the inside column diameter for open tubular columns and the particle size for packed columns, is the best approach to increase the separation speed in gas chromatography. Extremely fast analysis is only possible when the required number of plates to separate a critical pair of solutes is relatively low. Reducing the analysis time by reduction of the characteristic diameter is accompanied by a proportionally higher required inlet pressure. Due to the high resistance of flow of packed columns this seriously limits the use of packed columns for fast GC. For fast GC hydrogen has to be used as carrier gas and in some situations vacuum-outlet operation of capillary columns allows a further minimisation of the analysis time. For fast GC the columns should be operated near the conditions for minimum plate height. Linear temperature programmed fast GC requires high column temperature programming rates. Reduction of the characteristic diameter affects the sample capacity of the 'fast columns'. This effect is very pronounced for narrow-bore columns and in principle non-existing in packed columns. Multi-capillary columns (a parallel configuration of some 900 narrow-bore capillaries) take an intermediate position. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The 20th-century welfare states resulted as complex political mechanisms for converting economic growth into enhanced population health. However, the rise of a "neoliberal" agenda, denigrating the role of government, has once again brought to the fore the importance of prevention and a population health approach to map and publicize the health impacts of this new phase of "global" economic growth.},

  abstract = {The earth has been warmer in the first five months of this year than in any comparable period since measurements began 130 years ago, and the higher temperatures can now be attributed to a long-expected global warming trend linked to pollution, a space agency scientist reported today.

Until now, scientists have been cautious about attributing rising global temperatures of recent years to the predicted global warming caused by pollutants in the atmosphere, known as the ''greenhouse effect.'' But today Dr. James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration told a Congressional committee that it was 99 percent certain that the warming trend was not a natural variation but was caused by a buildup of carbon dioxide and other artificial gases in the atmosphere.

Dr. Hansen, a leading expert on climate change, said in an interview that there was no ''magic number'' that showed when the greenhouse effect was actually starting to cause changes in climate and weather. But he added, ''It is time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.'' An Impact Lasting Centuries

If Dr. Hansen and other scientists are correct, then humans, by burning of fossil fuels and other activities, have altered the global climate in a manner that will affect life on earth for centuries to come.

Dr. Hansen, director of NASA's Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, testifed before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

He and other scientists testifying before the Senate panel today said that projections of the climate change that is now apparently occurring mean that the Southeastern and Midwestern sections of the United States will be subject to frequent episodes of very high temperatures and drought in the next decade and beyond. But they cautioned that it was not possible to attribute a specific heat wave to the greenhouse effect, given the still limited state of knowledge on the subject. Some Dispute Link

Some scientists still argue that warmer temperatures in recent years may be a result of natural fluctuations rather than human-induced changes.

Several Senators on the Committee joined witnesses in calling for action now on a broad national and international program to slow the pace of global warming.

Senator Timothy E. Wirth, the Colorado Democrat who presided at hearing today, said: ''As I read it, the scientific evidence is compelling: the global climate is changing as the earth's atmosphere gets warmer. Now, the Congress must begin to consider how we are going to slow or halt that warming trend and how we are going to cope with the changes that may already be inevitable.'' Trapping of Solar Radiation

Mathematical models have predicted for some years now that a buildup of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil and other gases emitted by human activities into the atmosphere would cause the earth's surface to warm by trapping infrared radiation from the sun, turning the entire earth into a kind of greenhouse.

If the current pace of the buildup of these gases continues, the effect is likely to be a warming of 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit from the year 2025 to 2050, according to these projections. This rise in temperature is not expected to be uniform around the globe but to be greater in the higher latitudes, reaching as much as 20 degrees, and lower at the Equator.

The rise in global temperature is predicted to cause a thermal expansion of the oceans and to melt glaciers and polar ice, thus causing sea levels to rise by one to four feet by the middle of the next century. Scientists have already detected a slight rise in sea levels. At the same time, heat would cause inland waters to evaporate more rapidly, thus lowering the level of bodies of water such as the Great Lakes.

Dr. Hansen, who records temperatures from readings at monitoring stations around the world, had previously reported that four of the hottest years on record occurred in the 1980's. Compared with a 30-year base period from 1950 to 1980, when the global temperature averaged 59 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature was one-third of a degree higher last year. In the entire century before 1880, global temperature had risen by half a degree, rising in the late 1800's and early 20th century, then roughly stabilizing for unknown reasons for several decades in the middle of the century. Warmest Year Expected

In the first five months of this year, the temperature averaged about four-tenths of a degree above the base period, Dr. Hansen reported today. ''The first five months of 1988 are so warm globally that we conclude that 1988 will be the warmest year on record unless there is a remarkable, improbable cooling in the remainder of the year,'' he told the Senate committee.

He also said that current climate patterns were consistent with the projections of the greenhouse effect in several respects in addition to the rise in temperature. For example, he said, the rise in temperature is greater in high latitudes than in low, is greater over continents than oceans, and there is cooling in the upper atmosphere as the lower atmosphere warms up.

''Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming,'' Dr. Hansen said at the hearing today, adding, ''It is already happening now.''

Dr. Syukuro Manabe of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration testified today that a number of factors, including an earlier snowmelt each year because of higher temperatures and a rain belt that moves farther north in the summer means that ''it is likely that severe mid-continental summer dryness will occur more frequently with increasing atmsopheric temperature.'' A Taste of the Future

While natural climate variability is the most likely chief cause of the current drought, Dr. Manabe said, the global warming trend is probably ''aggravating the current dry condition.'' He added that the current drought was a foretaste of what the country would be facing in the years ahead.

Dr. George Woodwell, director of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass., said that while a slow warming trend would give human society time to respond, the rate of warming is uncertain. One factor that could speed up global warming is the widescale destruction of forests that are unable to adjust rapidly enough to rising temperatures. The dying forests would release the carbon dioxide they store in their organic matter, and thus greatly speed up the greenhouse effect. Sharp Cut in Fuel Use Urged

Dr. Woodwell, and other members of the panel, said that planning must begin now for a sharp reduction in the burning of coal, oil and other fossil fuels that release carbon dioxide. Because trees absorb and store carbon dioxide, he also proposed an end to the current rapid clearing of forests in many parts of the world and ''a vigorous program of reforestation.''

Some experts also believe that concern over global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels warrants a renewed effort to develop safe nuclear power. Others stress the need for more efficient use of energy through conservation and other measures to curb fuel-burning.

Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a national environmental group, said a number of steps can be taken immediately around the world, including the ratification and then strengthening of the treaty to reduce use of chlorofluorocarbons, which are widely used industrial chemicals that are said to contribute to the greenhouse effect. These chemicals have also been found to destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere that protects the earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.},

and technology and capacity building support. In this context, South Africa has transitioned
its international mitigation commitment from a relative “deviation from Business-as-usual”

size results in non-linear scaling of key performance parameters for combustion engines. These effects are
accentuated by chemical kinetics which assume significance for small scale engines given their high operating
speeds. Different methods of quantifying these scaling laws have been attempted, resulting in different outcomes.
Numerous studies in scaling laws were examined and compared as a first step in unifying the various methods and
their results. The outcome of this unification may provide more complete scaling laws to design higher performance
combustion engines, especially those small in size where scaling has significant effect on efficiency and power.
Increased performance of small combustion engines gives vast possibility to further applications in fields such as
aerospace, personal power and micro power generation.},

  abstract     = {This model of a combined bakery and brewery was discovered in a hidden chamber at the side of the passage 
  leading into the rock cut tomb of the royal chief steward Meketre, who began his career under King Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II 
  of Dynasty 11 and continued to serve successive kings into the early years of Dynasty 12. 
  
  The making of bread and beer was closely related in ancient Egypt, both using basically the same kind of ingredients. 
  The two processes are therefore combined here in one workshop complex, albeit with separate rooms. 
  A guard with a baton sits inside the screened off main doorway that leads first into the brewery. 
  Here a man crushes the grain with a pestle, then two women grind it into flour, which another man works into lumps of dough, 
  possibly adding yeast from the square basin in the corner. 
  After a second man has added water to the lumps of dough and treaded the mash with his feet in a tall vat, 
  the resulting liquid is set aside in four tall crocks to ferment. 
  After fermentation it is poured off into round jugs that are covered with black clay stoppers. 
  The bakery in the inner room is divided by a screen wall into two compartments. 
  In the first a man again crushes grain with a pestle for two female millers to grind into flour. 
  Two men then mix the dough in tall tubs, while two black ovens are tended by a man with a poker. 
  In the middle of it all stands a basket with baked conical loaves. In the second compartment are two more men with pestles; 
  two others make loaves and cakes of various shapes, some of which are baked on two circular stoves, 
  while some must have been carried over to the ovens in the first section of the room. 
  
  All the accessible rooms in the tomb of Meketre had been robbed and plundered already during antiquity; 
  but early in 1920 the Museum's excavator, 
  Herbert Winlock, wanted to obtain an accurate floor plan of the tomb's layout for his map of the Eleventh Dynasty 
  necropolis at Thebes and, therefore, had his workmen clean out the accumulated debris. It was during this cleaning 
  operation that the small hidden chamber was discovered, filled with twenty-four almost perfectly preserved models. 
  Eventually, half of these went to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo, and the other half came to the Metropolitan Museum in 
  the partition of finds.},

Aiming to contribute to the understanding of green chemistry, basically from a historical point of view, this overview argues that contextual influences and the user friendliness of the term are drivers for the explosive growth of green chemistry. It is observed that political support for its development has been significant, in which the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 was a formal political starting-point, but informally the origins of green chemistry go back to before 1990. US EPA played an important role in all this, but did not solely contribute to the growth of green chemistry.},

  abstract = {There is a need for the development of new processing techniques to facilitate vegetable oil extraction and refining while sustaining the nutritional components naturally present in edible oils and reducing the adverse impact of oil processing on the environment. In this study supercritical carbon dioxide (SC−CO2) extraction and fractionation techniques were examined as alternative methods to obtain wheat germ oil (WGO) of high quality and purity. It was shown that the SC−CO2 extraction technique is effective in extraction of WGO. There was no significant difference in the FA composition of SC−CO2- and hexane-extracted WGO. Both hexane-and SC−CO2-extracted WGO were rich in $\alpha$-tocopherol. Moisture content of the SC−CO2-extracted oil was higher than that of the hexane-extracted oil. Solvent/feed ratio had a significant effect on the SC−CO2 extraction yields. This study demonstrated that supercritical fluid fractionation was a viable process to remove FFA efficiently from both hexane-and SC−CO2-extracted WGO while retaining bioactive oil components in the final product.},
